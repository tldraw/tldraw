# tldraw ai starter

This repo is a starter for projects that use the [tldraw ai module](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/packages/ai).

To use:

1. Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root direectory.
2. Add your OpenAI key to that file as an environment variable, i.e. `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key`.
3. Install dependencies with `pnpm i`
4. Run `pnpm run dev`
5. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.

To hack:

- Edit the example system prompt at `worker/openai/system-prompt.ts`.
- Create new transforms and use them in `useTldrawAiExample`.
- Maybe replace the OpenAI service with your own.
