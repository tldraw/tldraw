# tldraw agent

This starter kit demonstrates how to build an AI agent that can manipulate the [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) canvas.

It features a chat panel on the right-hand-side of the screen where the user can communicate with the agent, add context and see chat history.

## Environment setup

Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root directory and add API keys for any model providers you want to use.

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

We recommend using Anthropic for best results. Get your API key from the [Anthropic dashboard](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

## Local development

Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`.

Run the development server with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.

Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser to see the app.
