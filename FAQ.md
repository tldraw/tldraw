### Can I use the tldraw SDK with Vue, Angular, or another framework?

Yes. The SDK's main export (`<Tldraw>`) is a regular React component. To render it in a different framework, you would use your framework's regular method of rendering React components. For example, in Vue you would use a [Vue connector](https://dev.to/amirkian007/how-to-render-react-components-in-vue-1e0f). In Angular, you would use an [Angular wrapper component](https://web-world.medium.com/how-to-use-react-web-components-in-angular-b3ac7e39fd17).

### How do I run code when the editor first mounts?

Use the `Tldraw` component's `onMount` callback. See [this example](https://tldraw.dev/examples/editor-api/api) for more about using the editor API.

```tsx
<Tldraw
	onMount={(editor) => {
		editor.selectAll()
	}}
/>
```

### How do I turn on / off dark mode?

Color theme preferences are stored in the user object. To change the theme at runtime, update the user preferences:

```ts
editor.user.updateUserPreferences({ colorScheme: 'dark' })
editor.user.updateUserPreferences({ colorScheme: 'light' })
editor.user.updateUserPreferences({ colorScheme: 'system' })
```

### How do I turn on / off readonly mode?

You can use the `Editor` API.

### How can I lock or unlock a shape?

### How do I prevent the camera from moving?
