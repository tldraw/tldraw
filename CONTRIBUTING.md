# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw)!

## Current policy

We are temporarily **automatically closing pull requests from external contributors**.

We continue to welcome issues, bug reports, and discussions. If you have a bug fix or feature you'd like to contribute, please [create an issue](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/new/choose) first to discuss it with us. If we agree that the change is needed and would like to accept a contribution, we will re-open the pull request.

This policy is temporary, and we hope to re-open contributions in the future. See [this issue](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7695) for more context.

Please see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for our expectations around contributor culture.
