# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw)! We welcome any contributions to the code base and the documentation.

## Create an Issue!

Before submitting a pull request, it is **strongly recommended** to [create an issue](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/new/choose) first to discuss your proposed changes. This will help us to make sure that your changes are aligned with the project goals and that you are not duplicating work that is already in progress.

If you are not sure whether your changes are needed, feel free to create an issue anyway and we can discuss it there. Once we have agreed on the changes, you can start working on them.

## Making Changes

We are currently **not accepting pull requests from external contributors**. Pull requests will be automatically closed. This is a temporary policy until GitHub provides better tools for managing contributions.

Like many open-source projects, we've seen a significant increase in contributions generated entirely by AI tools. While some are formally correct, most suffer from incomplete context, misunderstanding of the codebase, and little follow-up engagement from their authors. An open pull request represents a commitment from maintainers to review it carefully and consider it seriously for inclusion. For that commitment to remain meaningful, we need to be more selective.

For more details on this policy, see [this issue](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7695).

Please also see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for our expectations around contributor culture.
