# v3.0.0

Welcome to the 3.0.0 release of the tldraw SDK. This release includes a number of new features, improved features, and bug fixes.

The biggest change, and the reason for a new major version, is our new watermark and licenses. See the **New licenses** section below.

Thank you also to all of our first-time contributors: Alex ([@qwertyu-alex](https://github.com/qwertyu-alex)), [@dimitriadamou](https://github.com/dimitriadamou), Ravi theja ([@raviteja83](https://github.com/raviteja83)), & Zachary Wood ([@zacwood9](https://github.com/zacwood9)).

## What's new

### New license

This release includes new licenses for the tldraw SDK. These are meant to make the SDK more accessible to small teams and independent developers with commercial products.

Previously, the tldraw SDK was provided under a non-commercial license, with commercial licenses available for purchase separately. In this version, the tldraw SDK's new license permits use in both commercial non-commercial projects so long as our "Made with tldraw" watermark is visible.

If you wish to use the tldraw SDK without the watermark, you can purchase a Business License. You'll receive a License Key that hides the watermark while the license is active. For more information, or to request a business license, visit [tldraw.dev](https://tldraw.dev/#pricing)

The watermark is a link to [tldraw.dev](https://tldraw.dev). It becomes active after a short delay, ensuring that users don't accidentally click on it while trying to perform other actions on the canvas.

If you don't have a business license, then you must preserve the watermark as it is and not obscure it, disable it, or otherwise make it inaccessible to your users.

If you have questions or comments, let us know at hello@tldraw.com.

### Deep Links

'Deep Links' are URLs that point to a specific part of a document, like a particular shape or a particular part of a page. We added some APIs to help creating and using deep links, and for updating the current page's URL as the user navigates around the document.

See the [Deep Links documentation](https://tldraw.dev/examples/basic/deep-links) for more information and example code.

([#4333](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4333))

### Export custom shapes as images

Tldraw lets you convert the contents of your canvas to a PNG or SVG image. Previously, this relied on each shape implementing a method that would render it as an SVG. If your shape is complex with lots of HTML/CSS UI, this isn't an easy thing to do.

Now, custom shapes are supported in image exports by default. This relies on embedding HTML/CSS into an SVG which does have some issues, so it's worth reading about [image exports in tldraw](https://tldraw.dev/docs/editor#Image-exports) and testing the feature for yourself.

([#4403](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4403))

### Custom embeds API

Tldraw supports including content from other websites (e.g. YouTube, Google Maps, CodeSandbox) via the `embed` shape. Previously the list of supported websites was hard-coded. This release includes support to fully customize the list of supported websites. This means you can now add your own custom embeds, or remove existing ones.

([#4326](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4326))

### Enabling text search with the `getText` API

Previously there was no reliable way to get the human-readable text from a shape. This is now possible with the new `getText` API.

The main intended usage of this API is to implement text search in your application. We provide a basic example of how to go about that [here](https://tldraw.dev/examples/editor-api/text-search)

([#4306](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4306)) ([#4414](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4414))

### Move the camera while spacebar panning

While holding the space bar, use the arrow keys to move the viewport.

### Breaking changes

- Removes the `TLRotationSnapshot` type. This was exported by mistake and should not have been useful to SDK users.
- The `onEditorMount` option to `createTLStore` is now called `onMount`. ([#4320](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4320))
- `Editor.mark()` was deprecated in favour of `Editor.markHistoryStoppingPoint()`. ([#4250](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4250))

In most cases you can treat this as a renamed method. However if you previously passed an ID to `Editor.mark()`, you should now use the return value of `Editor.markHistoryStoppingPoint()` as the mark ID instead.

- Rename `TLSvgOptions` to `TLImageExportOptions` ([#4442](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4442))
- Setting `editor.updateInstanceState({isFocused: true})` no longer triggers a `focus` event on the canvas container. Use `editor.focus()` and `editor.blur()` instead.

### Improvements

- Enable interpolation method for all builtin shapes, including draw and highlighter. ([#4241](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4241))
- Custom shapes (and our own bookmark shapes) now render in image exports by default. ([#4403](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4403))
- We detect when there are multiple versions of tldraw installed and let you know, as this can cause bugs in your application. ([#4398](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4398))
- Improved `loadSnapshot` to preserve page state like camera position and current page if no session snapshot is provided. ([#4392](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4392))
- Make arrow labels reflow text dynamically. ([#4384](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4384))
- Prevent accidental creation of tiny fixed-width text shapes. ([#4293](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4293)) ([#4331](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4331))
- Upgrade fractional indexing to use jittered indexes, to help avoid conflicts ([#4312](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4312))
- Show ghost preview image whilst uploading images ([#3988](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3988))
- Update the 'x-box' icon to more closely resemble the shape itself. ([#4287](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4287))
