To control toasts and dialogs your app, you can use the `useToasts` and `useDialogs` hooks.
These hooks give you access to functions which allow you to add, remove and clear toasts
and dialogs.

Dialogs are especially customisable, allowing you to pass in a custom component to render
as the dialog content. Alternatively, you can use the `ExampleDialog` component which is
provided by the library.
