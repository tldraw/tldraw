### Core SDK Architecture

**Three-Layer System:**

1. **@tldraw/editor** - Pure canvas engine
   - No shapes, tools, or UI - just the reactive editor foundation
   - Shape system via ShapeUtil classes, Tools via StateNode state machines
   - Bindings system for relationships between shapes
   - Uses @tldraw/state for reactive state management

2. **@tldraw/tldraw** - Complete SDK
   - Wraps editor with full UI system, shape implementations, and tools
   - Default shapes: text, draw, geo, arrow, note, line, frame, highlight, etc.
   - Complete tool set: select, hand, eraser, laser, zoom + shape creation tools
   - Responsive UI with mobile/desktop adaptations

3. **@tldraw/store** - Reactive data layer
   - Type-safe record storage with automatic validation
   - Change history and undo/redo support
   - IndexedDB persistence and migration system
   - Built on @tldraw/state reactive signals

### Reactive State Management

**@tldraw/state - Signals Architecture:**

- Fine-grained reactivity similar to MobX or SolidJS
- `Atom<T>` for mutable state, `Computed<T>` for derived values
- Automatic dependency tracking during computation
- Efficient updates with minimal re-computation
- Memory-optimized with `ArraySet` and cleanup systems

**Pattern Throughout Codebase:**

- All editor state is reactive and observable
- Components automatically re-render when dependencies change
- Store changes trigger reactive updates across the system
- Batched updates prevent cascading re-computations

### Shape and Tool System

**Shape Architecture:**

- Each shape type has a `ShapeUtil` class defining behavior
- ShapeUtil handles geometry calculation, rendering, hit testing, interactions
- Extensible system - custom shapes via new ShapeUtil implementations
- Shape definitions in `@tldraw/tlschema` with validators and migrations

**Tool State Machines:**

- Tools implemented as `StateNode` hierarchies with parent/child states
- Event-driven architecture (pointer, keyboard, tick events)
- Complex tools like SelectTool have multiple child states (Brushing, Translating, etc.)
- State machines handle tool lifecycle and user interactions

**Bindings System:**

- Relationships between shapes (arrows connecting to shapes, etc.)
- `BindingUtil` classes define binding behavior and visual indicators
- Automatic updates when connected shapes change position/properties

## Testing Patterns

### Vitest Tests

**Unit Tests:**

- Test files named `*.test.ts` alongside source files (e.g., `LicenseManager.test.ts`)
- Integration tests use `src/test/feature-name.test.ts` format
- Test in tldraw workspace if you need default shapes/tools

**Running Tests:**

- Run from specific workspace directory: `cd packages/editor && yarn test run`
- Filter with additional args: `yarn test run --grep "selection"`
- Avoid root-level `yarn test` (slow and hard to filter)

### Playwright E2E Tests

- Located in `apps/examples/e2e/` and `apps/dotcom/client/e2e/`
- Use `yarn e2e` and `yarn e2e-dotcom` commands
- Comprehensive UI interaction testing

- Strict type checking across all packages
- Generated API documentation from TSDoc comments

**Linting and Formatting:**

- ESLint with custom configuration in `eslint.config.mjs`
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks via Husky ensuring quality

## Key Development Notes

### TypeScript Workflow

- Uses workspace references for fast incremental compilation
- Run `yarn typecheck` before commits (critical for API consistency)
- API surface validated with Microsoft API Extractor
- Strict type checking across all packages

### Monorepo Management

- Yarn workspaces with berry (yarn 4.x) - use `yarn` not `npm`
- Package manager enforced via `packageManager` field in package.json
- Dependencies managed at workspace level where possible
- Efficient disk usage with Plug'n'Play system

### Asset Management Workflow

- Icons, fonts, translations stored in `/assets` directory
- Run `yarn refresh-assets` after making asset changes
- Assets automatically bundled into packages during build process
- Shared across packages and applications with optimization

### Primary Development Environment

- Main development happens in `apps/examples` - the SDK showcase
- Examples demonstrate SDK capabilities and serve as development testbed
- See `apps/examples/writing-examples.md` for example guidelines
- Use examples app to test SDK changes in real scenarios

## Asset and Content Management

## Development Patterns

### Creating Custom Components

**Custom Shapes:**

1. Define shape type in schema with validator
2. Create `ShapeUtil` class extending base ShapeUtil
3. Implement required methods (getGeometry, component, indicator)
4. Register in editor via `shapeUtils` prop
5. Implement creation tool if needed

**Custom Tools:**

1. Create `StateNode` class with tool logic
2. Define state machine with onEnter/onExit/event handlers (onPointerDown, etc.)
3. Handle state transitions and editor updates
4. Register in editor via `tools` prop

### UI Customization

**Component Override System:**

- Every tldraw UI component can be replaced/customized
- Pass custom implementations via `components` prop
- Maintains responsive behavior and accessibility
- See existing components for architectural patterns

### Integration Patterns

**Embedding in Applications:**

- Import required CSS: `import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'` (full) or `import '@tldraw/editor/editor.css'` (editor only)
- Requires React 18+ and modern bundler support
- Works with Vite, Next.js, Create React App, and other React frameworks
- See templates directory for framework-specific examples
- Asset URLs configurable via `@tldraw/assets` package (imports, URLs, or self-hosted strategies)
- Use `npm create tldraw` CLI for quick project scaffolding

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Optimization

**Canvas Performance:**

- WebGL-accelerated minimap rendering
- Viewport culling - only visible shapes rendered
- Shape geometry caching with invalidation
- Efficient hit testing and bounds calculation

**Reactive System Optimization:**

- Signals minimize unnecessary re-renders via precise dependency tracking
- Computed values cached until dependencies change
- Store changes batched to prevent cascading updates
- Component re-renders minimized through React.memo and signal integration
- Uses `__unsafe__getWithoutCapture()` for performance-critical paths

### Memory Management

**Efficient Resource Usage:**

- Automatic cleanup of event listeners and signal dependencies
- Asset deduplication reduces memory footprint
- Store history pruning prevents unbounded growth
- Shape utility garbage collection when unused

## Licensing and Business Model

**SDK Licensing:**

- Open source with "Made with tldraw" watermark by default
- Business license available for watermark removal
