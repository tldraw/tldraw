// NOTE: ClientWebSocketAdapter requires its users to implement their own connection loss

//       the connection when a number of pings goes unanswered. Without this mechanism,
//       we might not be able to detect the websocket connection going down in a timely manner
//       (it will probably time out on outgoing data packets at some point).
//
//       This is by design. While the Websocket protocol specifies protocol-level pings,
//       they don't seem to be surfaced in browser APIs and can't be relied on. Therefore,
//       pings need to be implemented one level up, on the application API side, which for our
//       codebase means whatever code that uses ClientWebSocketAdapter.
/**
 * A WebSocket adapter that provides persistent connection management for tldraw synchronization.
 * This adapter handles connection establishment, reconnection logic, and message routing between
 * the sync client and server. It implements automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
 * and supports connection loss detection.
 *
 * Note: This adapter requires users to implement their own connection loss detection (e.g., pings)
 * as browser WebSocket APIs don't reliably surface protocol-level ping/pong frames.
 *
 * @internal
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Create a WebSocket adapter with connection URI
 * const adapter = new ClientWebSocketAdapter(() => 'ws://localhost:3000/sync')
 *
 * // Listen for connection status changes
 * adapter.onStatusChange((status) => {
 *   console.log('Connection status:', status)
 * })
 *
 * // Listen for incoming messages
 * adapter.onReceiveMessage((message) => {
 *   console.log('Received:', message)
