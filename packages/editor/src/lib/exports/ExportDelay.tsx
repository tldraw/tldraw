 * Export delay is a helper class that allows you to wait for a set of promises to resolve before
 * proceeding with an export. Over time, promises can be added by calling `waitUntil`.
 *
 * When `resolve` is called, we'll wait for all the promises already added (and any new ones added
 * in the mean time) to resolve before proceeding. The class is designed to be used once: after
 * `resolve` has been called and finished, new promises cannot be added.
