# How does pinching work?

The pinching handler is fired under two circumstances: 
- when a user is on a MacBook trackpad and is ZOOMING with a two-finger pinch
- when a user is on a touch device and is ZOOMING with a two-finger pinch
- when a user is on a touch device and is PANNING with two fingers

Zooming is much more expensive than panning (because it causes shapes to render), 
so we want to be sure that we don't zoom while two-finger panning. 

In order to do this, we keep track of a "pinchState", which is either:
- "zooming"
- "panning"
- "not sure"

If a user is on a trackpad, the pinchState will be set to "zooming". 

If the user is on a touch screen, then we start in the "not sure" state and switch back and forth
between "zooming", "panning", and "not sure" based on what the user is doing with their fingers.

In the "not sure" state, we examine whether the user has moved the center of the gesture far enough
to suggest that they're panning; or else that they've moved their fingers further apart or closer
together enough to suggest that they're zooming. 

In the "panning" state, we check whether the user's fingers have moved far enough apart to suggest
that they're zooming. If they have, we switch to the "zooming" state.

In the "zooming" state, we just stay zoomingâ€”it's not YET possible to switch back to panning.

todo: compare velocities of change in order to determine whether the user has switched back to panning
