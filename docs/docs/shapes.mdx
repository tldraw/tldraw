In tldraw, **shapes** are the things that are on the canvas. This article is about shapes: what they are, how they work, and how to create your own shapes. If you'd prefer to see an example, see the tldraw repository's [examples app](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/apps/examples) for examples of how to create custom shapes in tldraw.

## Custom shapes

Let's create a custom "card" shape.

### Shape type

In tldraw's data model, each shape is represented by a JSON object. Let's first create a type that describes what this object will look like. 

```ts
import { TLBaseShape } from '@tldraw/tldraw'

type CardShape = TLBaseShape<
  'card', 
  { w: number, h: number }
>
```

With the `TLBaseShape` helper, we define the shape's `type` property (`card`) and the shape's `props` property (`{ w: number, h: number }`). The type can be any string but the props must be a regular [JSON-serializable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#description) JavaScript object.

The `TLBaseShape` helper adds the other default properties of a shape, such as `parentId`, `x`, `y`, and `rotation`.

### Shape Util

While tldraw's shapes themselves are simple JSON objects, we use `ShapeUtil` classes to answer questions about shapes. For example, when the editor needs to know the bounding box of our card shape, it will find a `ShapeUtil` for the `card` type and call that util's `bounds` method, passing in the `CardShape` object as an argument.

Let's create a `ShapeUtil` class for the shape.

```tsx
import { ShapeUtil, HTMLContainer, Box2d } from '@tldraw/tldraw'

class CardShapeUtil extends ShapeUtil<CardShape> {
  static type = 'card' as const

  getDefaultProps(): CardShape['props'] {
		return {
			w: 100,
			h: 100,
		}
	}

  getBounds(shape: CardShape) {
		return new Box2d(0, 0, shape.props.w, shape.props.h)
	}

  component(shape: CardShape) {
    return (
      <HTMLContainer>Hello</HTMLContainer>
    )
  }

  indicator(shape: CardShape) {
    return (
      <rect width={shape.props.w} height={shape.props.h}/>
    )
  }
}
```

This is a minimal `ShapeUtil`. We've given it a static property `type` that matches the type of our shape, we've provided implementations for the abstract methods `getDefaultProps`, `getBounds`, `component`, and `indicator`.

We still have work to do on the `CardShapeUtil` class, but we'll come back to it later. For now, let's put the shape onto the canvas by passing it to the `<Tldraw>` component.

### Defining the shape

Before we pass the shape down, we need to package it up in a way using the `defineShape` function. We can then create an array of our defined shapes and pass them into the `<Tldraw>` component's `shapes` prop. 

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from '@tldraw/tldraw'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'

const MyCardShape = defineShape('card', { util: CardShapeUtil })
const MyCustomShapes = [MyCardShape]

export default function () {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw shapes={MyCustomShapes}/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

The `defineShape` function can also be used to include a tool that we can use to create this type of shape. For now, let's create it using the `Editor` API.

```tsx
export default function () {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw shapes={MyCustomShapes} onMount={editor => {
        editor.createShapes([{  type: "card" }])
      }}/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Once the page refreshes, we should now have our custom shape on the canvas.

## Using starter shapes

You can use "starter" shape utils like `BaseBoxShapeUtil` to get regular rectangular shape behavior.

## Flags

You can use flags like `hideRotateHandle` to hide different parts of the UI when the shape is selected, or else to control different behaviors of the shape.

> todo

## Interaction

You can turn on `pointer-events` to allow users to interact inside of the shape.

## Editing

You can make shapes "editable" to help decide when they're interactive or not.
