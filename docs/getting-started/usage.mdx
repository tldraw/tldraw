The [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component is the easiest way to get started. To use it, create a file like this one:

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from '@tldraw/tldraw'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function () {
	return (
		<div className="tldraw__editor">
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

### CSS

In order to use the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component, you should also import the `tldraw.css` file from the `@tldraw/tldraw` package. You can alternatively import this file inside of another CSS file using the `@import` syntax.

You can overwrite these files with other CSS or copy the contents into a different file and import that instead.

### HTML

If you're using the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component in a full-screen app, you probably also want to update your `index.html`'s meta viewport element as shown below. 

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

This may not be critical to [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) performing correctly, however some features (such as safe area positioning) will only work correctly if these viewport options are set.

## Using in Next.js, Create React App, Vite, etc.

Check the [examples repository](https://github.com/tldraw/examples) to see examples of tldraw being used in various frameworks.

By the way, the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component can't be server-rendered. If you're using the component in a server-rendered framework (such as Next.js) then you need to import it dynamically. 

## Going deeper

The [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component combines two lower-level components: [`<TldrawEditor>`](/gen/editor/TldrawEditor) and [`<TldrawUi>`](gen/ui/TldrawUi). If you want to have more granular control, you can use those lower-level components directly. See [this example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/apps/examples/src/examples/ExplodedExample.tsx) for reference.
