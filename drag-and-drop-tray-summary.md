# Drag and Drop Tray Example Summary

I've successfully created a comprehensive drag and drop tray example for tldraw located in `apps/examples/src/examples/drag-and-drop-tray/`. 

## Files Created

### 1. `DragAndDropTrayExample.tsx` (Main Component)
- **Features implemented:**
  - Fixed tray UI positioned on the right side of the screen using `InFrontOfTheCanvas`
  - 5 draggable items: snowman (‚õÑ), ice cream (üç¶), smiley (üòä), star (‚≠ê), and heart (‚ù§Ô∏è)
  - Complete drag and drop functionality with pointer event handling
  - Visual drag preview that follows the cursor
  - Automatic shape creation on canvas when items are dropped
  - ESC key support to cancel drag operations
  - Proper coordinate conversion from screen to canvas space
  - Clean state management for drag operations

### 2. `drag-and-drop-tray.css` (Styling)
- **Modern UI design:**
  - Clean, modern styling with subtle shadows and borders
  - Hover and active states for interactive feedback
  - Visual feedback during drag operations
  - Responsive design with proper spacing and typography
  - Professional color scheme with good contrast

### 3. `README.md` (Documentation)
- **Proper frontmatter** for automatic discovery by the examples system
- **Category:** UI (priority 2)
- **Clear description** of functionality
- **Links to tldraw documentation**

## Key Implementation Details

### Drag and Drop Mechanics
1. **Pointer Events:** Uses React's PointerEvent system for cross-device compatibility
2. **Document-level listeners:** Captures mouse movement outside the tray area
3. **Coordinate conversion:** Properly converts screen coordinates to canvas space using `editor.screenToPage()`
4. **Shape creation:** Creates text shapes with emoji content at drop locations

### User Experience Features
- **Visual feedback:** Drag preview follows cursor, tray items show active state
- **Cancellation:** ESC key cancels drag operation
- **Help text:** Shows instructions during drag operations
- **Smooth interactions:** CSS transitions for hover and active states

### Integration with tldraw
- Uses `InFrontOfTheCanvas` component for fixed positioning
- Integrates with tldraw's editor API for shape creation
- Follows tldraw's component override patterns
- Uses `track()` for reactive updates
- Proper event handling to prevent interference with canvas operations

## Usage
The example will be automatically discovered by the tldraw examples system and available at the drag-and-drop-tray route. Users can:

1. See the tray on the right side of the screen
2. Click and drag any emoji item
3. Drop it anywhere on the canvas to create a text shape
4. Press ESC during drag to cancel the operation

The example demonstrates advanced UI integration patterns and serves as a template for creating custom drag-and-drop functionality in tldraw applications.
