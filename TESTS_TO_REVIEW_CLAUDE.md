# Results

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/arraySet.test.ts

✅ Good. Tests are accurate and satisfactory. No additional review required.

### packages/tlschema/src/TLStore.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Reimplements the private `sortByIndex` helper inline and uses a placeholder assertion for `redactRecordForErrorReporting`, so the tests never exercise the actual implementation.

    🤠 human review
        - removed `sortByIndex` helper and fixed bug in TLStore where it `sortByIndex` was reimplemented instead of imported from utils package
        - exported and documented `redactRecordForErrorReporting` from `TLStore.ts` so it can be used in tests, fixed tests

### packages/utils/src/lib/media/webp.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Copies the unexported `isWebp` helper into the test suite; any regressions in the real function would go unnoticed because the duplicated logic always passes.

    🤠 human review : exported and documented `isWebp` and edited test file to take into account

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/arraySet.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Multiple `it.fails` cases document real bugs where `ArraySet.visit`/iterator drop `undefined` entries—confirmed against the implementation.

    🤠 human review : the behavior is not a bug as claude thought and the tests were updated to reflect this

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/computed.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! `it.fails` documents that `isComputed(null/undefined)` returns the input instead of `false` due to a truthy check in `Computed.ts`.

    🤠 human review : fixed `isComputed` and removed `it.fails` from test cases

### packages/tlschema/src/translations/translations.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! `it.fails` highlights that `getDefaultTranslationLocale` crashes when `window.navigator` is undefined because the implementation dereferences `navigator` before null checks.

    🤠⁉️ human review: `getDefaultTranslationLocale` now returns default `['en']` if window is defined but navigator isn't

### packages/worker-shared/src/sentry.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! `it.fails` shows `createSentry` doesn’t honor the documented “undefined means development” behavior and still calls `requiredEnv` when both `SENTRY_DSN` and `TLDRAW_ENV` are unset.

    🤠 human review: deleted test and removed outdated comment that claude based the test on

### packages/sync-core/src/lib/ClientWebSocketAdapter.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Several `it.fails` cases note missing reconnection behaviors (exponential backoff bounds, visibility-based delays, navigator.connection reactions) in `ReconnectManager`.

### packages/sync-core/src/lib/TLSyncClient.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Multiple `it.fails` cases mark gaps in handling old connect responses and `push_result` actions (rebase/discard/commit) in `TLSyncClient`.

### packages/tlschema/src/createTLSchema.test.ts

`test.fails` indicates `createTLSchema` does not validate the shape of custom schema props, so malformed definitions go through silently.

    🤠⁉️ human review: deleted contrived tests

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/helpers.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Incomplete testing of `__unsafe__getWithoutCapture` calls in `haveParentsChanged` function; mock-heavy approach for attach/detach may miss real integration issues; missing error handling tests.

    🤠 human review: claude fixing these issues

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/transactions.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Contains duplicate test cases (lines 562-580/904-922, 537-560/924-947) and AI-generated sections with generic names that need cleanup; some timing-dependent tests may be flaky.

    🤠 human review: removed duplicates and renamed things to be better

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/types.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Flaky epoch test (lines 232-234) was weakened to "made to pass" rather than fixed; tests access private properties via `any` casting breaking encapsulation.

    🤠 human review: fixed flaky epoch test, removed casting as any

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/warnings.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Non-deterministic test behavior due to module state persistence across test runs; conditional assertions make tests unreliable and dependent on execution order.

    🤠 human review: mocked the module

### packages/store/src/lib/devFreeze.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Critical issues with broken test logic - primitive handling inconsistency between production/development modes, circular reference "limitation" disguised as feature, tests "made to pass" rather than implementation fixed.

    🤠 human review: claude just _really_ doesn't like `devFreeze` function, the tests are acutally fine from what I can tell

### packages/store/src/lib/executeQuery.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Critical test logic error in duplicate property tests (lines 694-705, 721-730) - JavaScript object property overwrite makes tests not actually test claimed "multiple matchers" behavior.

    🤠 human review: deleted contrived tests

### packages/store/src/lib/Store.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Critical issues with fake validators using trivial pass-through validation (lines 27, 41, 54, 69) that bypass actual validation testing; missing validation error tests; incomplete side effects coverage.

    🤠 human review: working on it

### packages/store/src/lib/StoreQueries.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Tests access private implementation details using `(queries as any).indexCache` type casting making tests brittle; inconsistent behavior between empty query methods needs clarification.

### packages/sync-core/src/lib/protocol.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Hard-coded protocol version test is brittle; tests only structure not behavior; missing validation tests for invalid data; no integration testing of message flow.

### packages/sync-core/src/lib/RoomSession.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Major issue - tests only internal APIs marked with @internal; tests type definitions and constants instead of runtime behavior; most tests validate TypeScript compiler rather than actual functionality.

### packages/sync-core/src/lib/server-types.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Excessive use of `as any` type assertions throughout defeating TypeScript safety; tests implementation details rather than behavior; redundant testing of simple interfaces.

### packages/sync-core/src/lib/TLRemoteSyncError.test.ts

Good test quality with comprehensive coverage of the `TLRemoteSyncError` class functionality. All tests are passing and the implementation matches expected behavior. Some repetitive tests could be streamlined but no critical issues found.

### packages/sync-core/src/test/chunk.test.ts

Excellent - comprehensive and high-quality coverage for chunking functionality. Tests are well-structured, cover edge cases thoroughly, and follow good testing practices. No major issues identified.

### packages/sync-core/src/test/diff.test.ts

Well-written test suite with good coverage of core diffing functionality. Tests cover realistic scenarios and edge cases. No immediate human review required - tests properly validate working functionality.

### packages/sync-core/src/test/TLSocketRoom.test.ts

Good test quality but has minor issues with hard-coded protocol version and internal state testing. Should replace hard-coded protocol version with helper function and focus more on behavioral testing rather than internal state.

### packages/sync-core/src/test/TLSyncRoom.test.ts

High quality test suite with comprehensive coverage. Well-structured with proper isolation and good use of testing patterns. Tests both unit and integration scenarios effectively. Minor improvements suggested around internal API testing.

### packages/sync/src/useSync.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Critical issue - doesn't test actual `useSync` hook functionality at all, only validates TypeScript type definitions. Tests provide no confidence that the hook actually works and need complete redesign.

### packages/sync/src/useSyncDemo.test.ts

Good overall with comprehensive coverage but relies heavily on mocks. Tests demonstrate good patterns but could benefit from more integration testing and better error scenario coverage.

### packages/tlschema/src/assets/TLBaseAsset.test.ts

High quality tests with no issues found. Comprehensive coverage, excellent testing patterns, proper edge case handling. Serves as good example of schema testing.

### packages/tlschema/src/assets/TLBookmarkAsset.test.ts

High quality test suite with minor conditional test logic concerns. Some tests use runtime-dependent behavior which should be made deterministic. Otherwise comprehensive and well-structured.

### packages/tlschema/src/assets/TLImageAsset.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Critical migration behavior issues - tests reveal broken migration logic that overwrites existing values and inconsistent validation. Migration tests contradict actual migration behavior.

### packages/tlschema/src/assets/TLVideoAsset.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Good quality tests but reveal problematic migration behavior that overwrites existing values and unsafe error handling. Migration logic needs architectural review.

### packages/tlschema/src/bindings/TLArrowBinding.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! High quality comprehensive tests with one critical migration issue - migration overwrites existing `snap` values with default, potentially causing data loss.

### packages/tlschema/src/bindings/TLBaseBinding.test.ts

Good with minor issues around questionable edge case validity (empty ID suffixes). May need review of whether edge cases represent intended behavior or should be tightened.

### packages/tlschema/src/createPresenceStateDerivation.test.ts

High quality comprehensive tests with excellent coverage and organization. No critical issues found. Minor type safety improvements suggested with `as any` usage.

### packages/tlschema/src/misc/geometry-types.test.ts

Excellent tests with comprehensive coverage. Main issue is JSDoc examples in implementation file use non-existent `.check()` method instead of `.isValid()` - documentation needs correction.

### packages/tlschema/src/misc/id-validator.test.ts

Excellent - exceptionally well-written test suite with comprehensive coverage and best practices. Only issue is missing test coverage for some prefixes used in actual codebase.

### packages/tlschema/src/misc/TLColor.test.ts

Excellent test quality with comprehensive coverage, clear structure, and adherence to best practices. All tests pass successfully with no issues found.

### packages/tlschema/src/misc/TLCursor.test.ts

Excellent - exceptionally high quality with comprehensive coverage. Tests are well-structured, thorough, and follow tldraw testing conventions perfectly. No issues found.

### packages/tlschema/src/misc/TLHandle.test.ts

Good but has issues with immutability test that doesn't actually test mutation prevention, and heavy use of `as any` casting that reduces type safety validation. Needs fixing of test logic.

### packages/tlschema/src/misc/TLOpacity.test.ts

Excellent - exceptionally well-written with comprehensive coverage, excellent organization, and thorough edge case testing. No issues found, represents best practices.

### packages/tlschema/src/misc/TLScribble.test.ts

Well-structured comprehensive tests with one flawed immutability test that doesn't actually attempt mutation. Minor issues with test data consistency and hardcoded assumptions but overall good quality.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLAsset.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Well-structured tests but reveals potentially destructive migration behavior where AddMeta migration overwrites existing meta data with empty object, which could cause data loss.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLBinding.test.ts

Good quality with comprehensive coverage but missing runtime validation testing and some unsafe type assertions. Would benefit from validation edge case testing and error message quality validation.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLCamera.test.ts

Good quality with comprehensive coverage. One misleading migration test where comment contradicts test name - needs clarification on whether migration should preserve or override existing meta.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLDocument.test.ts

Good quality comprehensive tests. Minor concerns around business logic decisions like allowing negative grid sizes and some inconsistencies in test naming and migration behavior.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLInstance.test.ts

Very good quality with comprehensive coverage and excellent migration testing. Minor issues with type safety (using `as any`) and missing migration failure scenario testing.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLPage.test.ts

Good quality with comprehensive coverage but has potential index key testing gaps and missing validation error message tests. Some use of `as any` bypassing TypeScript validation.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLPageState.test.ts

Well-structured comprehensive tests with good coverage. Minor gaps in edge case coverage like array validation and ID format validation but no critical issues found.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLPointer.test.ts

Well-structured with one misleading test description that should be clarified. Good coverage overall but missing some edge cases like NaN coordinate testing and boundary value testing.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLPresence.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Well-structured tests but significant gaps in validation edge case coverage, type safety issues with extensive `as any` usage, and missing error handling tests.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLRecord.test.ts

Good quality comprehensive tests that pass and demonstrate proper testing patterns. No immediate human review required.

### packages/tlschema/src/records/TLShape.test.ts

Excellent - well-written comprehensive coverage with particularly strong migration testing. Tests effectively validate both type system and runtime behavior with no significant issues found.

### packages/tlschema/src/recordsWithProps.test.ts

Good quality comprehensive tests that demonstrate proper testing patterns. No immediate human review required.

### packages/tlschema/src/shapes/ShapeWithCrop.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Well-structured interface testing but critical gaps in runtime validation testing. Tests may be allowing invalid states that should be caught by validation.

### packages/tlschema/src/shapes/TLArrowShape.test.ts

High quality comprehensive testing with excellent migration coverage and proper edge case handling. Minor potential issue with one migration test comment/expectation mismatch.

### packages/tlschema/src/shapes/TLBaseShape.test.ts

Good quality comprehensive tests that demonstrate proper testing patterns. No immediate human review required.

### packages/tlschema/src/shapes/TLBookmarkShape.test.ts

Good quality comprehensive tests that demonstrate proper testing patterns. No immediate human review required.

Good quality comprehensive tests that demonstrate proper testing patterns. No immediate human review required.

### packages/tlschema/src/shapes/TLFrameShape.test.ts

Excellent - well-structured comprehensive testing with 51 passing tests, proper edge case handling and thorough migration testing. No immediate human review required.

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/constants.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Massive over-testing of a trivial constant (-1) with 18 test cases. This is a clear anti-pattern - effort should be redirected to testing actual business logic instead of literals. File should be refactored to single value assertion.

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/HistoryBuffer.test.ts

Excellent quality - comprehensive coverage with 36 passing tests, proper functional validation, excellent edge case testing, and follows best practices. No human review needed.

### packages/store/src/lib/BaseRecord.test.ts

Excellent - exceptionally well-designed with 46 passing tests, comprehensive coverage of CRUD operations, excellent edge case handling, and proper immutability validation. No human review needed.

### packages/store/src/lib/migrate.test.ts

Good quality but needs some improvements - excessive use of `as any` type assertions that could hide type safety issues, and missing error message validation in some tests. Otherwise comprehensive coverage of migration system functionality.

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/EffectScheduler.test.ts

Excellent - exceptional quality with 69 passing tests, comprehensive coverage including dependency tracking, transaction integration, error handling, and performance testing. Follows best practices with minimal type assertion usage. No human review needed.

### packages/store/src/lib/ImmutableMap.test.ts

Excellent - exemplary test suite with 60 passing tests, comprehensive edge case coverage, proper immutability testing, and performance validation. Demonstrates industry best practices for testing immutable data structures. No human review needed.

### packages/store/src/lib/RecordsDiff.test.ts

Excellent - high quality test suite with 56 passing tests, comprehensive operation testing (add/update/remove sequences), proper immutability validation, and complex scenario coverage. Minor pragmatic use of type assertions for test maintainability. No human review needed.

### packages/store/src/lib/setUtils.test.ts

Excellent - comprehensive testing with 31 passing tests, excellent edge case handling, proper type safety, and performance validation. Could serve as template for other utility function tests. No human review needed.

### packages/store/src/lib/StoreSchema.test.ts

🚨 Needs human review! Good functional coverage with 41 passing tests but uses weak no-op validators that make validation tests meaningless, plus excessive `as any` usage. Migration system testing is solid but validation pipeline needs strengthening with realistic validators.

### packages/state/src/lib/**tests**/isSignal.test.ts

Excellent - comprehensive testing with 24 passing tests, exceptional edge case coverage including DOM elements and circular references, and proper type guard validation. Demonstrates testing best practices. No human review needed.
