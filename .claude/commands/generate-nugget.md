# Generating nuggets

This command creates a nugget draft from raw notes.

## Before writing

1. Read the `write-nugget` skill for voice and structure guidelines
2. Read the raw notes (`{topic}-raw.md`) thoroughly
3. Verify accuracy by reading source files mentioned in the notes
4. Determine the next draft number

## Output

Save the draft as the next numbered file in the nugget folder (e.g., if `arc-arrows-2.md` exists, create `arc-arrows-3.md`).
