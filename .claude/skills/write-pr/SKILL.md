# Writing pull requests

Standards for PR titles and descriptions in tldraw/tldraw.

## PR title

Use semantic PR titles (Conventional Commits format):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Adding or fixing tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

### Scope (optional)

A noun describing the affected area: `fix(editor):`, `feat(sync):`, `docs(examples):`

### Examples

- `feat(editor): add snap threshold configuration option`
- `fix(arrows): correct binding behavior with rotated shapes`
- `docs: update sync documentation`
- `refactor(store): simplify migration system`

## PR body

Use this template:

```md
<description paragraph>

### Change type

- [x] `bugfix` | `improvement` | `feature` | `api` | `other`

### Test plan

1. Step to test...
2. Another step...

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] End to end tests

### Release notes

- Brief description of changes for users
```

### Description paragraph

Start with: "In order to X, this PR does Y."

- Keep it specific - avoid vague phrases like "improve user experience"
- Link related issues in the first paragraph
- Don't expect readers to also read the linked issue

### Change type

- Tick exactly one type with `[x]`
- Delete unticked items

### Test plan

- List manual testing steps if applicable
- Remove the numbered list if changes cannot be manually tested
- Tick checkboxes for included test types

### Release notes

- Write brief notes describing user-facing changes
- Use imperative mood: "Add...", "Fix...", "Remove..."
- Omit this section entirely for internal work (CI, tooling, tests, etc.) that has no user-facing impact

## API changes section

Include when changes affect `api-report.md`:

```md
### API changes

- Added `Editor.newMethod()` for X
- Breaking! Removed `Editor.oldMethod()`
- Changed `Editor.method()` to accept optional `options` parameter
```

## Related issues

Search for and link relevant issues that this PR addresses.

## Important

- Never include "Generated with Claude Code" unless the PR directly relates to Claude Code
- Never use title case for descriptions - use sentence case
