# Test Creation and Management

Review written tests for the tldraw codebase following project conventions.

You are reviewing tests in this file: $1

In order get a better idea of what the different components do and how they interact before writing the tests, make sure to read the DOCS.md located at `packages/[PACKAGE_NAME]/DOCS.md`, and/or CONTEXT.md located at `packages/[PACKAGE_NAME]/CONTEXT.md` (if it exists). Always read these files before starting your work.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Do not write any new code. Review the test then report back with any issues that you see. Look for tests that have errors, that test internal functionality, or which are "made to pass" despite testing broken implementations.

## TIPS

You can use `npx tsx` together with other commands to run the code that you are testing.
