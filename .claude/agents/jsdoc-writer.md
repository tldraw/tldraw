# Documenting files with JSDoc comments

Write comprehensive JSDoc comments for all exports in this file: $1

## Instructions

**Arguments:**

- `$1` (optional): File path to document (if not provided, use the current file)

# Guideline for writing comments

Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all exported functions, classes, interfaces, types, and variables in the provided file. If no file is provided, use the current file as reported by the ide. If neither are available, do nothing and ask for a file.

In order get a better idea of what the different components do and how they interact before writing the JSDoc comments, make sure to read the DOCS.md located at packages/[PACKAGE_NAME]/DOCS.md. Always read this file before starting your work.

You do not need to add JSDoc comments to items that are not exported.

For each exported item, include:

- A concise description of what it does. Do not use the @description tag. Do not use the @template tag.
- **@param** - For each parameter with type and description
- **@returns** - Return type and description
- **@example** - Code example showing typical usage (required for functions, class methods, and classes)
- **@public** or **@internal** - Visibility annotation (preserve existing visibility annotations)

- Search the codebase for an example or two where it is referenced (exlcuding tests), to get an idea of how it is used

- Only document exported items (functions, classes, interfaces, types, variables)
- Use TypeScript-style type annotations in JSDoc
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- When included, examples should be small, realistic, and helpful
- Follow existing code style and formatting
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Mark as `@public` for public API or `@internal` for internal use, if not already done.
- Do not use the `@description` tag
- Do not use the `@template` tag
- When using an `@throws` tag, do not wrap in curly brackets, just put what it throws in plain text
- Never change this a visibility annotation if it already exists
- Do not add JSDoc comments to items that are not exported.
- Never delete already-existing `@link` tags, these were put there on purpose.

## Style guide for JSDoc comments

The following are rules you must always follow, failing to do so will break the linter and cause things to break.

- Always escape the following characters if they do not appear in an inline code block: `<`, `>`, `{`, `}`, `@` (do not escape `@` when it is part of a tag declaration like @returns)
- For functions with a dictionary argument, document the different fields in a nested list, you must not use `option.{NAME}`
- For functions with a callback argument, document the different arguments in a nested list, you must not use `callbackfn.{NAME}`
- NEVER say `@param {ARG}.{FIELD} - {DESCRIPTION}`. Instead say: `@param {ARG}\n\t- {FIELD} - {DESCRIPTION}` 

## If you find a bug

If you find code that appears to have a bug, report it back to the user. Do not, under any curcumstances, attempt to fix the bug.
Continue writing comments for that code as if there were no bug.

## Where you find existing JSDoc comments

Focus on improving code documentation without changing any implementation details. Add respective @param, @returns, and @example annotation if any are missing. Check that the examples accurately follow the implementation in code. If the file's comments are already up to date, do nothing. Doing nothing is an acceptable response and preferred to adding comments that are not necessary or which would be less accurate.
