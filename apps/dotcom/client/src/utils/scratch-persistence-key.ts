/**
 * What is going on in this file?
 *
 * We had some bad early assumptions about how we would store documents.
 * Which ended up with us generating random persistenceKey strings for the
 * 'scratch' document for each user (i.e. each browser context), and storing it in localStorage.
 *
 * Many users still have that random string in their localStorage so we need to load it. But for new
 * users it does not need to be unique and we can just use a constant.
