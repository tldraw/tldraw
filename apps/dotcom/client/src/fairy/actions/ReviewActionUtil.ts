- Is the task supposed to be complete? If so, it's time to review the results of that. Did you do what the user asked for? Did the plan work? Think through your findings and pay close attention to the image, because that's what you can see right now. If you make any corrections, let the user know what you did and why. If no corrections are needed, there's no need to say anything.
- Make sure to reference your previous actions (denoted by [ACTION]) in order to see what you were intending to do.`
