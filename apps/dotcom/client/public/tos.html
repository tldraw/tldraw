For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-80ef-985f-d79f710edb8c" class=""><strong>13.2 Informal Dispute Resolution. </strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and tldraw. If that occurs, tldraw is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and tldraw agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution”</strong>). You and tldraw therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (<strong>“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”</strong>). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-8091-a7e1-eefbf77e66de" class="">The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (<strong>“Notice”</strong>), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  Notice to tldraw that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to legal@tldraw.com or regular mail to our offices located at 548 Market Street - Suite 85507, San Francisco, CA 94104.  The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your Account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-80c1-bb1b-e075bfb9e94d" class="">The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.  In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-8036-8352-d67331c63009" class=""><strong>13.3 Waiver of Jury Trial. </strong>YOU AND TLDRAW HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and tldraw are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 1. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-8034-b4a2-f54f5feea13a" class=""><strong>13.4 Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> YOU AND TLDRAW AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 9, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 13.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and tldraw agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.

If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and tldraw agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement.

The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 13.9. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.

If you or tldraw need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-80c7-8150-d5cdfcd58e74" class=""><strong>13.9 Batch Arbitration. </strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and agree that tldraw in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against tldraw by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (<strong>“Batch Arbitration”</strong>).</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-80b1-88c5-eab53e406d37" class="">All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.  To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (<strong>“Administrative Arbitrator”</strong>).  In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.  The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by tldraw.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-8009-a33f-e31680af7b28" class="">You and tldraw agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-801a-b0b8-c31a40f2de0e" class="">This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p id="1843e4c3-24c0-8077-a90b-fa415d5179d3" class=""><strong>13.10 30-Day Right to Opt Out. </strong>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 548 Market Street - Suite 85507, San Francisco, CA 94104, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
