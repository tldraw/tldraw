Assets are dynamic records that store data about a shared asset. For example, our image and video
shapes refer to assets rather than embedding their source files directly. Asset storage and
retrieval is controlled by [`TLAssetStore`](?). Different [`TLStore`](?) setups require different asset setups:

- By default, the store is in-memory only, so [`inlineBase64AssetStore`](?) converts images to data
  URLs.
- When using the [`persistenceKey` prop](/docs/persistence#The-persistenceKey-prop), the store is
  synced to the browser's local
  [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), so we store images
  there too.
- When using a [multiplayer sync server](/docs/sync), you would implement TLAssetStore to upload
  images to e.g. an S3 bucket.

## Examples

While we're working on docs for this part of the project, please refer to the examples below:

- [Using hosted images](/examples/data/assets/hosted-images)
- [Customizing the default asset
  options](/examples/data/assets/asset-props)
- [Handling pasted / dropped external
  content](/examples/data/assets/external-content-sources)
- [A simple asset store that uploads content to a remote
  server](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/templates/simple-server-example/src/client/App.tsx)
- [A more complex asset store that optimizes images when retrieving
  them](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/packages/sync/src/useSyncDemo.ts#L87)
