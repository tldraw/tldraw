In tldraw, a **tool** is a top-level state in our state chart. The select tool, draw tool, and arrow tool are all examples of tools—each defines how the editor responds to user input while that tool is active.

For a full guide to the tool system, including state hierarchy, event handling, child states, tool lock, creating custom tools, and overriding defaults, see the [Tools](/sdk-features/tools) page.

## Default and custom tools

The `<Tldraw>` component includes default tools like [select](/reference/tldraw/SelectTool), [hand](/reference/tldraw/HandTool), [draw](/reference/tldraw/DrawShapeTool), and [arrow](/reference/tldraw/ArrowShapeTool). The core `@tldraw/editor` package has no built-in tools—if you use `<TldrawEditor>` directly, you provide your own.

You can create custom tools by extending [StateNode](/reference/editor/StateNode) and passing them to the `tools` prop:

```tsx
import { StateNode, TLPointerEventInfo, Tldraw } from 'tldraw'

class StampTool extends StateNode {
	static override id = 'stamp'

	onPointerDown(info: TLPointerEventInfo) {
		// Create a shape at the click position
	}
}

export default function App() {
	return <Tldraw tools={[StampTool]} />
}
```

## Changing tools

Change the active tool with [editor.setCurrentTool](/reference/editor/Editor#setCurrentTool):

```ts
editor.setCurrentTool('select')
editor.setCurrentTool('hand')
editor.setCurrentTool('draw')
```
