Welcome to the tldraw developer docs.

Here at tldraw, we make two things: a very good multiplayer whiteboard (at [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com)) and the [open source](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) libraries used to create that product. This page is meant to provide documentation and reference for those open source libraries.

<Playground files={{
	'App.tsx': {
		code: `import { Tldraw } from '@tldraw/tldraw'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/ui.css'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/editor.css'

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}`, active: true }
}}/>

You can use the `<Tldraw>` React component to build on top of the default tldraw experience. It's easy to use and easy to extend with your own [custom shapes](/ucg/shapes), [custom tools](/ucg/tools), and [user interface](/ucg/user-interface) overrides. 

If you want to go even deeper, you can use the `<TldrawEditor>` component as a more minimal engine without the default tldraw shapes or user interface.

And in either case, you can use the [Editor API](/ucg/editor) to drive the experience programatically in order to create or delete shapes, control the camera, or do just about anything you can imagine.

Best of all, you can easily plug tldraw into the [collaboration backend](/ucg/collaboration) of your choice.

- Want to explore the code? Visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw)).
- Want to try it out? Visit the [examples sandbox](https://stackblitz.com/github/tldraw/tldraw/tree/examples?file=src%2F1-basic%2FBasicExample.tsx).

Otherwise, continue on to the [installation](/ucg/installation) and [usage](/ucg/usage) guides.
