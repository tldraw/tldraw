The tldraw SDK supports real-time collaboration. Add collaboration to your project with our [tldraw sync](/docs/sync) library, or use our low-level data APIs to integrate other backends.

<div className="article__image" style={{ border: 'none' }}>
	<img
		alt="Multiplayer example using tldraw sync"
		src="/images/multiplayer.gif"
		style={{
			mask: 'url(/images/multiplayer_mask.png) luminance center 100% / 100% no-repeat',
			WebkitMask: 'url(/images/multiplayer_mask.png) luminance center 100% / 100% no-repeat',
		}}
	/>
</div>

## Quick start

The fastest way to add multiplayer is with the `useSyncDemo` hook from [`@tldraw/sync`](/docs/sync). This connects to a hosted demo server that handles synchronization.

```bash
npm install @tldraw/sync
```

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import { useSyncDemo } from '@tldraw/sync'

function MyApp() {
	const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId: 'my-unique-room-id' })
	return <Tldraw store={store} />
}
```

Any apps connecting to the same room ID will enter a shared collaboration session. Open your project in an incognito window or different browser to test it out.

The demo server is great for prototyping, but data only lasts 24 hours and rooms are publicly accessible. For production, you'll need to self-host the tldraw sync server—see our full guide on [tldraw sync](/docs/sync).

## Using other backends

While [tldraw sync](/docs/sync) is our recommended solution, the tldraw SDK works with any real-time data backend. For example, [Liveblocks offers a tldraw integration](https://liveblocks.io/examples/tldraw-whiteboard), and many teams have connected tldraw to their own infrastructure.

Collaboration involves three concerns:

- **Synchronizing data** — Getting document changes in and out of the [store](/sdk-features/store). See [Persistence](/docs/persistence) for the basics, or [Collaboration](/sdk-features/collaboration) for building custom sync.
- **User presence** — Sharing cursor positions, selections, and viewports with other users. See [Collaboration](/sdk-features/collaboration) for presence APIs and [Cursors](/sdk-features/cursors) for customizing how collaborator cursors appear.
- **Collaboration UI** — The visual elements that show other users on the canvas. See [UI components](/sdk-features/ui-components) for overriding components like `CollaboratorCursor`, `CollaboratorBrush`, and `SharePanel`.
