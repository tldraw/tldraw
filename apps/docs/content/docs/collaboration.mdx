The tldraw SDK includes deep support for real-time collaboration. The easiest way to add collaboration to your project is with our [tldraw sync](#tldraw-sync) library. Or you can use our low-level data APIs to integrate [Liveblocks](#Liveblocks) or [other backends](#Using-other-collaboration-backends).

## tldraw sync

[tldraw sync](/docs/sync) is our library for fast multi-user collaboration. It's purpose-built for the tldraw canvas and it's what we use to power collaboration on our flagship app tldraw.com.

You can read our full article on [tldraw sync](/docs/sync).

### tldraw sync demo

To make it easier to get started with collaboration in tldraw, we've included a "demo" hook in the sync library that connects to a hosted backend. You can see a working example at [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/tldraw-sync-demo-d9vq5g?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A9%2C50).

Let's say you have an app running locally that looks like this:

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'

function MyApp() {
	return <Tldraw />
}
```

To make this app collaborative, first install the `@tldraw/sync` library:

```bash
npm install @tldraw/sync
```

Back in your code, import the `useSyncDemo` hook from the `@tldraw/sync` library. In the `MyApp` component, call the `useSyncDemo` hook with a room ID. Pass the [`store`](/docs/persistence#The-store-prop) returned by `useSyncDemo` to the tldraw component's `store` prop.

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import { useSyncDemo } from '@tldraw/sync'

function MyApp() {
	const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId: 'my-unique-room-id' })
	return <Tldraw store={store} />
}
```

In your browser, open an incognito window and visit your project's URL. You can also use a different browser or different device. The key is the room ID: any apps connecting to the same room ID will enter into a shared collaboration session.

### Limitations of the demo

The sync demo is great for prototyping but you should not use it in production. Data on the demo server only lasts for up to 24 hours, and anyone using the same room id will be able to edit the same room's project.

### Using tldraw sync in production

To use tldraw sync in production, you will need to self-host the tldraw sync server. To learn more, see our article on [tldraw sync](/docs/sync).

> We don't offer a hosted solution for tldraw sync in production, but if you're interested in that please let us know at hello@tldraw.com.

## Liveblocks

[Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) is a complete collaboration infrastructure, and its [Realtime APIs](https://liveblocks.io/realtime-apis) product provides a hosted back-end that can be used to synchronize tldraw in production.

Liveblocks offers two different methods for persisting data, [Storage](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/realtime-apis/liveblocks-storage) and [Yjs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/realtime-apis/liveblocks-yjs). Storage is quicker, and is the recommended solution, though if your app is using Liveblocks Yjs already, using this will help you take advantage of the shared undo/redo stack.

### Get started

To get started with tldraw and Liveblocks Storage, view a [live preview](https://liveblocks.io/examples/tldraw-whiteboard/nextjs-tldraw-whiteboard-storage), or run the following command to download a Next.js app featuring collaborative tldraw:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --example nextjs-tldraw-whiteboard-storage
```

A similar [live preview](https://liveblocks.io/examples/tldraw-whiteboard/nextjs-tldraw-whiteboard-yjs) and command can be used for Liveblocks Yjs:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --example nextjs-tldraw-whiteboard-yjs
```

### Advantages

A major advantage of Liveblocks is that it comes with [a Node.js SDK](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node), [REST APIs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints), and [webhooks](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/webhooks), meaning you can create intial tldraw content from the server, and respond to basic events that occur, such as non-specific canvas updates or users entering rooms.

Other advantages of using Liveblocks include [DevTools](https://liveblocks.io/devtools) for checking tldraw state, [React library](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react) for building custom features, and [React components](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui) built for adding commenting, notifications, and collaborative text editing to your app.

## Using other collaboration backends

While tldraw sync is our recommended and best-supported backend for tldraw, we designed the tldraw SDK to work with any data solution.

As a reference, our [tldraw-yjs example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-yjs-example) shows an integration between tldraw and the [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) CRDT library.

Whichever backend you choose, adding collaboration to tldraw will involve synchronizing data, sharing user presence, and handling user assets.

### Synchronizing data

For more information about how to synchronize the tldraw editor's store with other processes (i.e. how to get data out and put data in, including from remote sources) see the [Persistence](/docs/persistence) page.

### User presence

The tldraw SDK has support for displaying the 'presence' of other users. Presence information consists of the user id, name, and color, as well as their canvas context, such as their current page, pointer position, selection, viewport.

A user's presence is stored as `instance_presence` ([TLInstancePresence](?))records in the editor's store, however the data itself may be derived from other sources.

We provide a helper, [createPresenceStateDerivation](?), for constructing a reactive signal for an `instance_presence` record locally, which can then be sent to other clients somehow.

To the editor, any `instance_presence` records that belong to other users (i.e. those with a different user id than the editor's configured user id) are considered "collaborators". The editor has two methods, `getCollaborators` and `getCollaboratorsOnCurrentPage`, which return reactive signals about the current collaborators.

See the [yjs-example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-yjs-example/blob/45dfe7589ae44e4aaf9bb7359d0372f3a88bd597/src/useYjsStore.ts) for an example of how these records may be created, shared, and updated.

### Collaboration UI

The `tldraw` library includes several components specifically designed for collaboration.
You can remove, replace, or customize these using the editor's `components` prop. See [TLComponents](?) for more info.

- Collaborator cursors: [`TLComponents#CollaboratorCursor`](?)
- Cursor chat: [`TLComponents#CursorChatBubble`](?)
- Offline indicator: [`TLComponents#TopPanel`](?)
- Collaborator list: [`TLComponents#SharePanel`](?)
