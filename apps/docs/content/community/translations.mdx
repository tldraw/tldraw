The tldraw user interface (in [@tldraw/ui](/docs/user-interface)) is currently translated into over thirty different languages, with twenty languages at above 70% completion. Where a key's translation is missing in the user's current language language, the default (English) translation will be used instead.

## Contributing translations

We manage our translations through [Lokalise](https://www.lokalise.com), a long-time tldraw sponsor. If you would like to help by translating or reviewing translations, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.tldraw.com/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=sociallink) so that we can add you to the project.
