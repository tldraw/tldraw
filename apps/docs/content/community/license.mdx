This article is about the [tldraw license](/legal/tldraw-license). The tldraw SDK's source code and published packages are provided under the tldraw license.

Under its default terms, the tldraw SDK license permits use **only in development**.

To use the tldraw SDK **in production**, you need either a:

- [trial license](#trial-license) for evaluation;
- [commercial license](#commercial-license) for commercial projects; or a
- [hobby license](#hobby-license) for non-commercial projects.

The SDK enforces its license using [license keys](#license-keys).

Trial, commercial, and hobby licenses each come with a license key. The SDK will work in production only when provided with a valid and active license key. See the [License Keys](#license-keys) section for more information about license keys.

### Trial license

You can get a free 100-day trial license by completing [this form](https://tldraw.dev/get-a-license/trial). When you submit the form, we will immediately begin your free trial and email you a [license key](#license-keys). You are allowed only one trial license per commercial unit. Please do not abuse trial licenses and tell your friends not to, either. During your trial, the SDK [collects information](#data-collection) about where it is used.

The license key will stop working when the trial ends. If you wish to continue using tldraw in production after this date, you will need to get either a [commercial license](#commercial-license) or a [hobby license](#hobby-license).

### Commercial license

You can request a commercial license by completing [this form](https://tldraw.dev/get-a-license/plans). When you submit the form, our sales team will be in touch to learn about your requirements and discuss pricing. If your company has less than ten people, and if you have no special requirements, the price for a commercial license is $6000.

### Hobby license

For non-commercial projects, education projects, and small projects, we also provide a discretionary hobby license. You can request a hobby license by completing [this form](https://tldraw.dev/get-a-license/hobby). When you submit the form, our team may issue a license or reach out to learn about your project. When using the tldraw SDK under a hobby license, the "made with tldraw" watermark must be shown on the canvas.

## License keys

The tldraw SDK enforces its license using **license keys**.

When you receive a trial, commercial, or hobby license, you will also receive a public license key that encodes information about your license. You can provide this license key to the SDK as shown below.

```tsx
function App() {
	return <Tldraw licenseKey="tldraw-***********************" />
}
```

License keys are validated **on the client**. You can use them offline. They can be public.

Business and Hobby license keys will only work on pre-agreed domains. Trial license keys will work on any domain.

The tldraw SDK will not work in production without a valid license key.

## Data collection

When using the tldraw SDK under a commercial or hobby license, no information is sent to tldraw.

When using the tldraw SDK in production under a trial license, the tldraw SDK will ping tldraw's servers with a hash of the license key. This information is primarily for analytics purposes. No user data, canvas contents, or personally-identifiable information (PII) is sent or saved.

## Notes on Open Source

While the tldraw SDK is [source available](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), it is not permissively licensed. Many of our examples and demos are available under an MIT licenses, and you should feel free to use this code as if it were your own; however the any source code or packages licensed by the tldraw SDK would not be [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) by any definition.

If you wish to include tldraw in an open source project, you may do so but the SDK itself must remain under its original license. This means that you and your down-stream users will require their own trial, commercial, or hobby license in order to use the SDK in production. In this case, please also see our [trademark guidelines](https://tldraw.dev/legal/trademark-guidelines) that limit the use of the tldraw name and branding.

The tldraw SDK is a product of a company. See [tldraw.dev](https://tldraw.dev/company) for more information about the company and the team.
