## How to use your license key

License keys control functionality and remove watermarks in production environments. Here's how to integrate them:

### Basic integration

```tsx
<Tldraw
	licenseKey={process.env.TLDRAW_LICENSE_KEY}
	// ... other props
/>
```

### Key management best practices

- Store keys as environment variables, not in source code.
- Monitor key expiration dates in your deployment pipeline.

## License key mechanics

### Technical enforcement

The SDK includes built-in validation that:

- Verifies license key authenticity and expiration.
- Detects whether you're running locally or in a production environment.
- Based on license type, enforces watermark display.
- If applicable, checks that it is being used on a valid domain.

### Validation process

Validation happens client-side during SDK initialization:

1. Key format and signature verification.
2. Expiration date checking.
3. Environment type detection (local vs hosted).

## Special conditions and requirements

### Environment detection

The SDK automatically detects your deployment environment:

- **Development environment**: Single computer without network deployment.
- **Production environment**: Servers, cloud platforms, or web applications.

The SDK also works in offline mode.

### Watermark requirements

- Default and Hobby licenses must display the tldraw watermark.
- You should not disable, hide, remove, or alter the watermark under Default license.
- Trial and Commercial licenses remove the watermark requirement.

### Domain and usage restrictions

- License keys may include domain restrictions (check your specific license terms).
- Cannot distribute the SDK as a standalone product.
- Cannot sublicense, rent, lease, or transfer license rights.
- Must preserve all copyright and proprietary notices.

### Offline usage

License does not require network connectivity.

- Initial validation happens during SDK initialization.
- In case of the watermark, a single fetch is sent for the watermark svg but the license would still work if the fetch would fail.

## FAQ

### What happens if I don't have a valid key?

Without a valid key in production environments, the SDK will not function at all.

### Can I use the key in development and test environments?

Yes, license keys work across development, staging, and production environments. However, we do have domain restrictions in place, so if your environments have different domains, they need to be included in the licensed domains.

### What should I do when my license is expiring?

In order for tldraw SDK to function in production environments, the license key is needed. Reach out to the team who will help you get set up with the appropriate next license. To ensure uninterrupted service please reach out at least 30 days before your license key expires.
