Release notes for all tldraw SDK versions. Each minor release has its own page documenting new features, breaking changes, API additions, improvements, and bug fixes. Patch releases are listed within their parent minor release.

For the original releases, see the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/releases).

## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Instead:

- Major version bumps are rare. We reserve them for fundamental changes to how the SDK works.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence, approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating at a similar pace and checking the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.
