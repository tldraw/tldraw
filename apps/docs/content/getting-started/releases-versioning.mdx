## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## What's new

#### Expand helpers available in actions / toasts overrides. ([#5041](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5041))
