## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.10.0](/releases/v3.10.0)

Welcome to the 3.10.0 release of tldraw. This month's SDK release's big news is adding rich text to all of our shapes.

## What's new

#### Rich text ([#4895](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4895))

Tldraw now has the supports rich text as a first-class primitive within the Editor. After deliberating on which rich text editor to choose, we settled on using [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) as our out-of-the-box solution. Our basic implementation includes the TipTap [StarterKit](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit) extension along with a couple extra extensions to make the experience butter-smooth.

Of course, we wouldn't be providing this functionality if it wasn't extensible and remixable by the community. There is a `textOptions` property now that lets you customize TipTap and add/remove extensions as per your needs.

Take a look at our [Shapes documentation](https://tldraw.dev/docs/shapes#Editing) to learn more.

Please do jump in the [Discord](https://discord.tldraw.com/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=sociallink) if you have any feedback or bugs about this new feature.
