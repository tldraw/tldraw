## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.12.0](/releases/v3.12.0)

### Release Notes

v3.12.0 of the tldraw SDK includes several bug fixes and API improvements. The main feature development focus was on accessibility, building on initial work in v3.11.0 which added a focus ring.

### Accessibility features

- You can now move your selection between shapes using the keyboard (using `Tab` and `Cmd/Ctrl`+`Arrow`) ([#5761](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5761))
- Screen reader support for tool changes ([#5634](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5634))
- Screen reader support for shape selection changes ([#5773](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5773))
- Shapes can now be resized using the keyboard (using `Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift` with the `+`/`-` keys) ([#5826](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5826))
- More of our UI elements have the correct `role` applied, and use the correct semantic html5 tags ([#5847](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5847))

Accessibility is something we’ve been researching internally for a while now, investing in some R&D projects to see what’s possible on a 2D canvas. We’re continuing to mature our processes around accessibility with an eye on achieving WCAG in the near future.

### API additions

- Frames can now have color. Set the `showColors` option on the `FrameShapeUtil` class to display colorful borders and labels for frames. ([#5283](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5283))

  ```tsx
  import { FrameShapeUtil, Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
  import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

  const shapeUtils = [FrameShapeUtil.configure({ showColors: true })]

  export default function App() {
  	return (
  		`<div className="tldraw__editor">`
  			<Tldraw shapeUtils={shapeUtils}>`</Tldraw>`
  		`</div>`
  	)
  }
  ```

- There’s a new `getShapeVisibility` prop to replace `isShapeHidden`, which is now deprecated. `getShapeVisibility` allows a child of a hidden parent to override its parent and become visible. See the [Layer Panel Example](https://tldraw.dev/examples/ui/layer-panel). ([#5762](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5762))
- The `Geometry2d` class has a couple of new helper methods for calculating intersection points (`intersectLineSegment` and `intersectCircle`), a new helper method for applying a transformation matrix (`transform`), and new filtering options to allow excluding certain parts of geometry from calculations. ([#5754](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5754))
- We now individually export two of our default Tiptap extensions (for rich text) ([#5874](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5874))
  - `KeyboardShiftEnterTweakExtension` which inserts a normal line break when pressing shift+enter (tldraw doesn’t support soft breaks).
  - `TextDirection` which ensures the text directionality is saved and reinstated correctly.

### Other improvements

- The syntax for defining keyboard shortcuts is now more intuitive ([#5605](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5605))
  - e.g. `'?!l’` becomes `'alt+shift+l'` and `'$s'` becomes `'ctrl+s,cmd+s'`
  - See https://tldraw.dev/reference/tldraw/TLUiToolItem#kbd
  - The old syntax is still supported for now, but may be deprecated in the future.
- `Store.mergeRemoteChanges` is now atomic, and side effects are triggered in the correct scopes. ([#5801](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5801))
- Drawing is now smoother on slower CPUs by using [getCoalescedEvents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/getCoalescedEvents). ([#5898](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5898))
- We now allow overriding the asset urls for the icons used by the Embed shape to be null/empty in cases where the Embed shape is not needed. This prevents tldraw downloading a handful of icon assets that would never be used. ([#5736](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5736))
- YouTube embeds now support the t/start/loop parameters. ([#5726](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5726))

### Bug fixes

- SVGs can now be pasted in Firefox. ([#5789](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5789))
- Text exports from pages that include TailwindCSS no longer have unexpected borders. ([#5792](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5792))
- Pasting images now triggers just one ‘create’ effect per image shape, before it would trigger a ‘create’ and then immediately an ‘update’. ([#5800](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5800))
- Pasting shapes from Miro no longer crashes tldraw. ([#5790](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5790))
- Setting `zoomSpeed` in camera options no longer breaks zooming on safari trackpads and multitouch pinch to zoom. ([#5771](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5771))
- Fix a minor style issue in the PeopleMenu component. ([#5753](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5753))
- Resolve some performance regressions related to rich text. ([#5743](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5743)) ([#5735](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5735)) ([#5734](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5734))
- `Group2D.getSvgPathData()` now sets the starting points of its children correctly. ([#5580](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5580))
- Resolve a performance regression related to drawing on an iPad ([#5888](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5888))
- Prevent a crash when trying to render UI for tools that have been removed ([#5849](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5849))
