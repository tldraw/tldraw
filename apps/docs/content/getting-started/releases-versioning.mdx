## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.9.0](/releases/v3.9.0)

### Release Notes

This update brings some important bug fixes and performance improvements. It's low on user-facing changes, but we're laying the groundwork for some exciting new features in 3.10.

#### What's new

- Layout methods (align, distribute, flip, stack) have had a bunch of bug fixes and now work much better with arrows and overlapping shapes. ([#5479](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5479))
- Creating and deleting shapes, bindings and other records is now faster thanks to a new `AtomMap` class. You can use this to build your own efficient reactive maps too. ([#5496](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5496))
- Arrows bound to text shapes now have some horizontal padding. It looks a lot better. ([#5487](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5487))

#### Breaking changes

- `store.createSelectedComputedCache` has been removed. Use `store.createCache` and create your own selector `computed` instead.
- `createComputerCache` no longer accepts a single `isEqual` fn as its 3rd argument. Instead, pass in an options object, with the `isEqual` fn named `areRecordsEqual`. You can now pass `areResultsEqual`, too.

#### Bug fixes

- Pasted image sizes are now calculated more accurately. ([#5509](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5509))
- The `canvas-size` dependency, which was causing issues with some bundler configurations, has been removed. ([#5488](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5488))
- Copy as SVG now has the correct mimetype. ([#5482](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5482))
- Prevent a crash that could happen when cloning text shapes. ([#5470](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5470))
- Fix a regressing that prevented temporary image previews from showing while images are uploading. ([#5453](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5453))
- `https://localhost` is now considered to be development for license/watermark purposes. ([#5471](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5471))
