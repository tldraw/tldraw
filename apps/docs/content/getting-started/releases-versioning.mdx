## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.13.0](/releases/v3.13.0)

The big new feature in this months release is Elbow Arrows! These connectors supplement our existing arrow shape and are well suited to more technical diagramming type use-cases. We’re also been continuing to work on accessibility in tldraw, and there are plenty of other performance improvements too.

#### Elbow arrows

The arrow shape now supports elbow arrows! Instead of a single straight line or arc, these arrows get from A to B in a series straight lines joined at right angles. Access the new arrow type by selecting the arrow tool, and choosing the new option under the "Line" style.

#### Accessibility features

We’re continuing to work on accessibility in this release, as we make progress towards WCAG compliance.

- More icons and handles in the UI now have labels. ([#6001](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6001))
- ⌘⇧↓ and ⌘⇧↑ moves the selection in and out of container shapes, like frames and groups. ([#5973](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5973))
- You can now tab into embed shapes. ([#5958](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5958))

#### Breaking changes

#### Improvements

- Standardised gradient and hover effects for open submenu items are standardised across the UI. ([#5974](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5974))
- Frames can now be resized to fit their contents by double-clicking their edges. ([#5967](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5967))

#### API additions

- The text measurement API now accepts arbitrary styles to be applied to the text being measured. ([#6014](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6014))
- A new `Overlays` component lets you add overlays on top of the canvas that still follow the camera. ([#5952](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5952))
- `RichTextLabel` now accepts a `hasCustomTabBehavior` prop to disable our default tabbing logic where needed. ([#5908](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5908))

#### Other improvements

- Improve performance of a programatically rotating shape when it is selected ([#6023](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6023))
- Dragging many shapes at once is now much faster. ([#5821](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5821))
- Errors in tldraw no longer prompt users to open an issue on GitHub, as they were getting confused between tldraw and products that use the SDK. ([#5947](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5947))

- Remove jitter from arrows & lines as their size changes in some browsers. ([#5975](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5975))
- Long-pressing the enter key no longer enters edit mode. ([#5957](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5957))
