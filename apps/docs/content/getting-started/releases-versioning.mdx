## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.14.0](/releases/v3.14.0)

This release includes new features, improvements, and many bug fixes.

## New Features

- Image and video shapes now have a contextual toolbar ([#4443](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4443), [#6264](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6264))
- Added a UI component `TldrawUiContextualToolbar` to allow creating floating toolbars more easily. ([#4443](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4443), [#6264](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6264))
- Image and video shapes now support downloading the original file via a built in action. ([#6221](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6221))
- Images have new advanced cropping options ([#4443](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4443)) ([#6323](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6323)) ([#6294](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6294))
- Introduce `PathBuilder`, a new API to make constructing tldraw-style inky and dashed SVGs much easier ([#6112](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6112))
- Support configuring when arrows should be exact and/or bind ([#6290](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6290)). Thanks to community member [@trygve-aaberge-adsk](https://github.com/trygve-aaberge-adsk) for the contribution!
- Added `measureScrollWidth` option to text measurement options ([#6255](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6255))
- Allows for `VideoShapeUtil` autoplay behaviour to be configured using the `defaultAutoplay` boolean property ([#6070](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6070)) Thanks to community member [@elstob](https://github.com/elstob) for the contribution!

## Breaking Changes

- Remove `Editor#getShapePageGeometry` ([#6202](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6202))
- `Editor#getShapesAtPoint` now returns shapes in descending order of index ([#6208](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6208))
- Locked shapes can no longer be duplicated, and pasting a locked shape onto the canvas now unlocks it ([#6275](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6275))
- Removed `ShapeUtil.canDropShapes`. ([6139](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6139)). Previously, a ShapeUtil used `canDropShapes` to identify as a potential drop target for certain dragging shapes. Now any shape that implements the drag and drop handlers will participate in the drag and drop system.
