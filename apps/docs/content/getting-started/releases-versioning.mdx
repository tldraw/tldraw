## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.8.0](/releases/v3.8.0)

This update brings a host of improvements across performance, user interface, and developer experience—all while squashing a number of bugs. Read on for a quick summary of the highlights.

### What's New

#### Shape & Asset Enhancements

- **ShapeUtil.configure for shape options** ([#5399](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5399)). Introduces a new utility for passing options to shape utils. (This change also moves note shape resize mode and max draw shape points to their respective configuration objects.)
- **Note Shape Resize Option.** The note shape can be configured to resize by scale. ([#5273](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5273))
- **Asset uploads updated** ([#5218](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5218)). The upload API now returns an object with both the asset `src` and optional metadata—allowing for richer asset records.
- **New "select geo tool" shortcut** ([#5341](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5341)). Quickly select your most recent geometric tool with the `g` shortcut.
- **Drag URLs onto the canvas** ([#5411](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5411)). Drag a URL or link onto the canvas to create a bookmark shape.

#### Developer Experience & API Improvements

- **Exports DX Pass** ([#5114](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5114)). We’ve refined export functionality:
    - The copy/export as JSON option has been removed.
    - Export APIs (like `Editor.getSvgElement` and `Editor.getSvgString`) now handle shape selections more gracefully.
    - Export contexts now expose `scale` and `pixelRatio` options and offer a `resolveAssetUrl` helper.
    - A new `Editor.toImage` method simplifies creating images from your canvas.
- **i18n Enhancements** ([#5208](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5208)). Expanded our localization support to cover the top 40 languages.
- **React 19** ([#5293](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5293)). tldraw now supports React 19.
- **Easier external content customisation** ([#5298](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5298), [#5402](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5402)). You can re-use our default handlers, and now customise pasted tldraw & excalidraw content.
- **Customize input event handling** ([#5319](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5319)). Listen to the `before-event` event to run custom code before tldraw handles input events.
- **Custom cropping** ([#5137](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5137)). There’s a new `onCrop` method that `ShapeUtil`s can implement to opt-into & customize cropping.

### Breaking Changes

- **Shape Options Configuration.** With the introduction of `ShapeUtil.configure`, if you pass in a shape util that shares a type with a default, it now replaces the default instead of crashing. In addition, the previous `options.maxDrawShapePoints` is now set via:
    - `DrawShapeUtil.configure({ maxPoints })`
    - `HighlightShapeUtil.configure({ maxPoints })` ([#5399](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5399), [#5349](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5349))
- **Asset Upload API Changes.** In `@tldraw/tlschema`, `TLAssetStore.upload` now returns an object with `{ src, meta? }` rather than just the source string. Similarly, `Editor.uploadAsset` has been updated to reflect this change. ([#5218](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5218))
- **Export Functionality.** The option to copy/export as JSON has been removed since it was not fully supported. Additionally, hooks like `useImageOrVideoAssetUrl` now require a `width` parameter, and export methods have been updated to export all shapes when no IDs are provided. ([#5114](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5114))

### Bug Fixes

- **UI & Interaction Bugs**
    - Resolved dialog and edit menu glitches ([#5274](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5274)).
    - Addressed problems with mousewheel events not working on scrollable elements ([#5356](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5356)).
- **Asset & Export Fixes**
    - Ensured images in exports use the uncropped width ([#5300](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5300)).
    - Corrected paste behavior for text/plain via keyboard shortcuts ([#5303](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5303)).

### Performance & Reliability

- **Improved performance for headings** ([#5413](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5413)). Improved frame performance by relocating computations to their point of use.
