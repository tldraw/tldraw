Have five minutes? Let's try out the tldraw SDK in a React project. If you're new to React, we recommend using a [Vite template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) as a starter. We'll assume your project is already running locally.

Prefer to jump straight to some code? Try this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/tldraw-demo-76t444?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A14%2C2).

## Getting started

First, install the `tldraw` package from NPM:

```bash
npm install tldraw
```

Next, in you React project, import the `Tldraw` component and tldraw's CSS styles. Then render the `Tldraw` component inside a full screen container:

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

That's pretty much it! At this point, you should have a complete working single-user canvas. You can draw and write on the canvas, add images and video, zoom and pan, copy and paste, undo and redo, and do just about everything else you'd expect to do on a canvas.

You'll be starting from our default [shapes](/docs/shapes), [tools](/docs/tools), and [user interface](/docs/user-interface), but you can customize all of these things for your project if you wish. For now, let's show off a few more features.

## Local persistence

Let's add local persistence by passing a `persistenceKey` prop to the `Tldraw` component:

<FocusLines lines={[4]}>

```tsx
export default function App() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw persistenceKey="example" />
		</div>
	)
}
```

</FocusLines>

Using a `persistenceKey` will use your browser's storage to ensure that your project can survive a browser refresh. It will also synchronize the project between other instances that share the same `persistenceKey`â€”including in other browser tabs! Give it a try by opening your app in a second window.

## Real-time collaboration

To add support for multiple users collaborating in realtime, you can use the [**tldraw sync**](/docs/sync) demo library. This library is a simple way to try out real-time collaboration in tldraw using temporary projects called rooms.

First, install the `@tldraw/sync` package:

```bash
npm install @tldraw/sync
```

Next, import the `useSyncDemo` hook from the `@tldraw/sync` package. Call it in your component with a unique ID and pass the store that it returns to the `Tldraw` component:

<FocusLines lines={[2,6,10]}>

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import { useSyncDemo } from '@tldraw/sync'
import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function App() {
	const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId: 'myapp-abc123' })

	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw store={store} />
		</div>
	)
}
```

</FocusLines>

Try it out by opening your project in a second incognito window, or else access it from another device. You should see all of tldraw's multiplayer features: live cursors, user names, viewport following, cursor chat, and more.

If you want to go further with real-time collaboration, be sure to check out our guide to the [**tldraw sync**](/docs/sync) library.

## Controlling the canvas

One of the best parts of tldraw is its [editor](/docs/editor)'s runtime JavaScript API. Almost everything that can happen in tldraw can be done programmatically through the [Editor](?) instance.

For simplicity's sake, let's roll back our persistence and sync code. We can then use the `Tldraw` component's `onMount` callback to get access to the [Editor](?) instance. We'll use the editor to create a new shape on the canvas, select it, then slowly zoom to it.

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function App() {
	const handleMount = (editor) => {
		editor.createShape({
			type: 'text',
			x: 200,
			y: 200,
			props: {
				text: 'Hello world!',
			},
		})

		editor.selectAll()

		editor.zoomToSelection({
			animation: { duration: 5000 },
		})
	}

	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw onMount={handleMount} />
		</div>
	)
}
```

The [Editor](?) is tldraw's huge god object for controlling the canvas. Be sure to check out the [Editor](?) API documentation for more information on what you can do with it, as well as our guide on using the [editor](/docs/editor).

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen how the tldraw canvas works, you can:

- Create your own [shapes](/docs/shapes) and [tools](/docs/tools)
- Customize the [user interface](/docs/user-interface)
- Learn more about the [editor](/docs/editor)

You can do a lot with the tldraw SDK. In addition to our long-form docs, we have dozens of examples in our [examples section](/examples) that cover more of its functionality. You can run these locally with the tldraw [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw).

Remember: if you build something incredible, please share it with us in our [#show-and-tell](https://discord.com/invite/SBBEVCA4PG) channel on Discord. Good luck!
