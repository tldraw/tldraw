<h2>Add a tldraw canvas to your React app in just 5 minutes.</h2>

You can use the tldraw SDK to craft infinite canvas experiences for the web. It's perfect for collaborative whiteboards but you can use it for lots of other things, too.

By the end of this guide you will have made something that looks like this:

<Embed className="article__embed--quickstart" src="https://examples.tldraw.com/develop" />

### 1. Installation

- Set up a React project however you normally do. [We recommend Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
- Install the tldraw library using this command:

```bash
npm install tldraw
```

### 2. Import styles

To import fonts and CSS for tldraw:

- Create or edit a css file called `index.css`
- Copy and paste this into the file:

```CSS
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@500;700&display=swap");
@import url("tldraw/tldraw.css");

body {
  font-family: "Inter";
}
```

### 3. Render tldraw component

To render the Tldraw component

- Import the `<Tldraw />` component from the tldraw` package
- Import the `index.css` CSS file from earlier
- Wrap the Tldraw component in a `<div>` element with the style attribute set to: `{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }`

This will render a full screen canvas:

```javascript
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import './index.css'

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

### 4. Sync betweens users

At this point, you have a complete working single-user whiteboard. To add support for multiple users
collaborating in realtime, you can use the **tldraw sync** extension library.

```bash
npm install @tldraw/sync
```

Set up your component with our demo server:

- Import the `useSyncDemo` hook from the `@tldraw/sync` package
- Add the hook to your component with a unique `roomId`
- Pass the `store` returned from the hook into your `<Tldraw />` component

{/* <FocusLines lines={[2, 6, 10]}> */}

```javascript
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import { useSyncDemo } from '@tldraw/sync'
import './index.css'

export default function App() {
	const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId: 'myapp-abc123' })

	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw store={store} />
		</div>
	)
}
```

{/* </FocusLines> */}

## Next Steps

Now that you have your canvas working, you can:

- [Customize the UI](/docs/user-interface) of the editor
- Add your own [shapes](/docs/shapes) and [tools](/docs/tools)
- Replace our sync demo server with a [more robust sync backend](/docs/sync)

We provide the above examples and more in our [examples section](/examples). Go build something creative and please do share it with us in our [#show-and-tell](https://discord.com/invite/SBBEVCA4PG) channel on Discord!
