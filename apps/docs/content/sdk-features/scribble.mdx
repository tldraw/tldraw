The scribble system draws temporary freehand paths for pointer-based interactions. Use scribbles to show visual feedback during tool operations like erasing, laser pointer drawing, or scribble-brush selection. Access the system through `editor.scribbles`.

Scribbles exist only in instance state and fade out automatically after the tool operation completes. They're never persisted to the document.

## How it works

### Scribble lifecycle

Every scribble moves through four states:

1. **Starting**: The scribble collects points until it has more than 8. This prevents flickering for very short strokes.
2. **Active**: The scribble accumulates points as the pointer moves.
3. **Paused**: The scribble stops accumulating points but stays visible at its current length. Use this when you need to temporarily freeze a scribble without triggering the fade-out.
4. **Stopping**: The scribble fades out by progressively removing points from its tail. Once all points clear, the manager deletes the scribble.

The ScribbleManager's `tick` method updates all scribbles on every animation frame, handling state transitions, point management, and fade-out timing.

### Fade-out behavior

When you stop a scribble, it shrinks from the tail by removing points at regular intervals. If you set `shrink` greater than zero, the stroke width also decreases during fade-out, creating a smooth disappearance effect.

The `delay` property controls how long a scribble stays at full length before shrinking. The laser pointer uses this to create a trailing effect that persists briefly before disappearing.

## Using scribbles

Here's a complete example of a tool state that uses scribbles:

```typescript
import { StateNode } from '@tldraw/editor'

export class Lasering extends StateNode {
	static override id = 'lasering'

	scribbleId = ''

	override onEnter() {
		const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
			color: 'laser',
			opacity: 0.7,
			size: 4,
			delay: this.editor.options.laserDelayMs,
			shrink: 0.05,
			taper: true,
		})
		this.scribbleId = scribble.id
		this.pushPointToScribble()
	}

	override onExit() {
		this.editor.scribbles.stop(this.scribbleId)
	}

	override onPointerMove() {
		this.pushPointToScribble()
	}

	private pushPointToScribble() {
		const { x, y } = this.editor.inputs.getCurrentPagePoint()
		this.editor.scribbles.addPoint(this.scribbleId, x, y)
	}
}
```

### Creating a scribble

Call `editor.scribbles.addScribble()` with optional configuration. The method returns a scribble item containing the scribble's ID:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'laser',
	opacity: 0.7,
	size: 4,
	delay: 1000,
	shrink: 0.05,
	taper: true,
})
```

### Adding points

As the pointer moves, add points using the scribble ID. The manager automatically deduplicates points that are too close together:

```typescript
const { x, y } = this.editor.inputs.getCurrentPagePoint()
this.editor.scribbles.addPoint(scribble.id, x, y)
```

The `addPoint` method accepts an optional third parameter `z` (defaults to `0.5`) that controls point pressure for variable-width strokes.

### Stopping a scribble

When the tool operation completes, stop the scribble to begin fade-out:

```typescript
this.editor.scribbles.stop(scribble.id)
```

The scribble transitions to stopping state and removes itself once all points clear.

## Scribble properties

Scribbles support these visual properties:

| Property  | Default    | Description                                                                     |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `color`   | `'accent'` | Canvas UI color: `'accent'`, `'laser'`, `'muted-1'`, `'selection-stroke'`, etc. |
| `size`    | `20`       | Stroke width in pixels                                                          |
| `opacity` | `0.8`      | Transparency from 0 to 1                                                        |
| `delay`   | `0`        | Milliseconds before shrinking starts (for trailing effects)                     |
| `shrink`  | `0.1`      | Rate at which stroke width decreases during fade-out (0 to 1)                   |
| `taper`   | `true`     | Whether the stroke tapers at the ends                                           |

All properties have defaults, so you only need to specify what you want to change.

## Common use cases

### Eraser tool

The eraser uses a thick, semi-transparent scribble to show the erasure path:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'muted-1',
	size: 12,
})
```

### Laser pointer

The laser pointer uses `delay` and `shrink` to create a trailing effect that persists briefly:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'laser',
	opacity: 0.7,
	size: 4,
	delay: this.editor.options.laserDelayMs, // default 1200ms
	shrink: 0.05,
	taper: true,
})
```

### Scribble-brush selection

The selection tool uses scribbles for freehand selection with a distinctive color:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'selection-stroke',
	opacity: 0.32,
	size: 12,
})
```

## Customizing scribble rendering

You can override the scribble component to customize how scribbles render. Pass a custom `Scribble` component through the `components` prop:

```tsx
import { Tldraw, TLEditorComponents } from 'tldraw'
import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

const components: TLEditorComponents = {
	Scribble: ({ scribble, opacity, color }) => {
		return (
			<svg className="tl-overlays__item">
				<polyline
					points={scribble.points.map((p) => `${p.x},${p.y}`).join(' ')}
					stroke={color ?? 'black'}
					opacity={opacity ?? '1'}
					fill="none"
				/>
			</svg>
		)
	},
}

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw components={components} />
		</div>
	)
}
```
