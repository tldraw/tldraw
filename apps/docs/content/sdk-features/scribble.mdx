notes: "Good technical coverage of the scribble system. Voice is mostly good but has some passive constructions and could be more direct. Completeness could add more on when to use paused state. Accuracy issues fixed: updated laser example to use editor.options.laserDelayMs; corrected lifecycle to include paused state."

The scribble system provides temporary freehand visual feedback for pointer-based interactions. Scribbles are ephemeral paths that appear during tool operations and automatically fade out after completion. The system is accessed via `editor.scribbles` and manages multiple concurrent scribbles through a state-based lifecycle.

Scribbles are not persisted to the document. They exist only in the instance state and provide real-time visual feedback for operations like erasing, laser pointer drawing, and scribble-brush selection.

## How it works

### Scribble lifecycle

Every scribble progresses through a sequence of states managed by the ScribbleManager:

1. **Starting**: The scribble is initialized and collects its first 8 points. This prevents flickering for very short strokes.
2. **Active**: The scribble actively accumulates points as the pointer moves. Points are added with each pointer move event.
3. **Paused**: The scribble is temporarily paused.
4. **Stopping**: The tool has finished, and the scribble begins fading out by progressively removing points from its tail. After all points are cleared, the scribble is deleted from the manager.

The manager updates all active scribbles on every animation frame via its `tick` method, which handles state transitions, point management, and the fade-out effect.

### Fade-out behavior

When a scribble enters the stopping state, it shrinks from the tail by removing points at regular intervals. If the scribble has a `shrink` property greater than zero, its stroke width also decreases during the fade-out, creating a smooth disappearance effect.

The `delay` property controls how long a scribble remains at full length before starting to shrink. For the laser pointer, this creates a trailing effect that persists briefly before disappearing.

## Using scribbles

### Creating a scribble

Tools create scribbles by calling `editor.scribbles.addScribble()` with optional configuration:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'laser',
	opacity: 0.7,
	size: 4,
	delay: 1000,
	shrink: 0.05,
	taper: true,
})
```

### Adding points

As the pointer moves, add points to the scribble using the returned scribble ID:

```typescript
const { x, y } = this.editor.inputs.getCurrentPagePoint()
this.editor.scribbles.addPoint(scribble.id, x, y)
```

The manager automatically deduplicates points that are too close together, ensuring smooth rendering.

### Stopping a scribble

When the tool operation completes, stop the scribble to begin the fade-out:

```typescript
this.editor.scribbles.stop(scribble.id)
```

The scribble transitions to the stopping state and removes itself once all points are cleared.

## Scribble properties

Scribbles support extensive visual customization:

- **color**: A canvas UI color like `'accent'`, `'laser'`, `'muted-1'`, or `'selection-stroke'`
- **size**: Stroke width in pixels
- **opacity**: Transparency from 0 to 1
- **delay**: Milliseconds before the scribble starts shrinking (used for trailing effects)
- **shrink**: Rate at which the stroke width decreases during fade-out (0 to 1)
- **taper**: Whether the stroke tapers at the ends

Default values are set automatically but can be overridden when creating the scribble.

## Common use cases

### Eraser tool

The eraser creates a thick, semi-transparent scribble to show the erasure path:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'muted-1',
	size: 12,
})
```

### Laser pointer

The laser pointer uses delay and shrink properties to create a trailing effect:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'laser',
	opacity: 0.7,
	size: 4,
	delay: this.editor.options.laserDelayMs, // default 1200ms
	shrink: 0.05,
	taper: true,
})
```

### Scribble-brush selection

The selection tool uses scribbles for freehand selection with a distinctive color:

```typescript
const scribble = this.editor.scribbles.addScribble({
	color: 'selection-stroke',
	opacity: 0.32,
	size: 12,
})
```
