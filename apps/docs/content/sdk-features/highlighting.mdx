Shape highlighting shows visual indicators on shapes to provide feedback during user interactions. The editor tracks two types of highlighting: **hover** (the shape under the pointer) and **hints** (shapes you want to emphasize programmatically).

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw
				onMount={(editor) => {
					// Highlight specific shapes with a visual indicator
					const shapes = editor.getCurrentPageShapes()
					if (shapes.length > 0) {
						editor.setHintingShapes([shapes[0]])
					}
				}}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

## Hover highlighting

The editor automatically tracks which shape is under the pointer and displays a selection-style indicator around it. This happens during idle states when the pointer moves over the canvas.

### Reading hover state

Use [Editor#getHoveredShapeId](?) or [Editor#getHoveredShape](?) to check which shape is currently hovered:

```typescript
// Get the hovered shape ID
const hoveredId = editor.getHoveredShapeId()

// Get the full shape object
const hoveredShape = editor.getHoveredShape()

if (hoveredShape) {
	console.log('Hovering over:', hoveredShape.type)
}
```

### Setting hover manually

Use [Editor#setHoveredShape](?) to override the automatic hover detection:

```typescript
// Set hover by shape or ID
editor.setHoveredShape(myShape)
editor.setHoveredShape(myShape.id)

// Clear hover
editor.setHoveredShape(null)
```

Use this to highlight a shape that isn't directly under the pointer, such as when implementing custom interaction logic.

### Automatic hover detection

The editor's select tool automatically updates hover state as the pointer moves. The hover indicator appears when:

- The editor is idle or editing a shape
- The pointer is over the canvas (not UI elements)
- The input is not coarse (not touch input)
- The editor is not changing styles

Touch devices don't show hover indicators because touch has no hovering concept.

## Hint highlighting

Hints let you highlight multiple shapes programmatically. Unlike hover (single shape, automatic), hints are manually controlled and can include any number of shapes.

### Reading hints

Use [Editor#getHintingShapeIds](?) or [Editor#getHintingShape](?) to get currently hinted shapes:

```typescript
// Get array of hinted shape IDs
const hintedIds = editor.getHintingShapeIds()

// Get array of hinted shape objects
const hintedShapes = editor.getHintingShape()
```

### Setting hints

Use [Editor#setHintingShapes](?) to highlight shapes:

```typescript
// Highlight shapes by ID or shape object
editor.setHintingShapes([shape1, shape2])
editor.setHintingShapes([shape1.id, shape2.id])

// Clear all hints
editor.setHintingShapes([])
```

Hinted shapes render with a thicker stroke (2.5px) than selected or hovered shapes (1.5px). This makes them stand out when you need to draw attention to specific shapes.

### Common use cases

**Draw attention to shapes during a tutorial:**

```typescript
function highlightNextStep(editor: Editor, shapeId: TLShapeId) {
	editor.setHintingShapes([shapeId])
	// Clear after 3 seconds
	setTimeout(() => {
		editor.setHintingShapes([])
	}, 3000)
}
```

**Show related shapes when one is selected:**

```typescript
editor.sideEffects.registerAfterChangeHandler('instance_page_state', (prev, next) => {
	const selected = next.selectedShapeIds
	if (selected.length === 1) {
		// Find bindings connected to the selected shape
		const bindings = editor.getBindingsToShape(selected[0], 'arrow')
		const connectedShapeIds = bindings.map((b) => b.fromId)
		editor.setHintingShapes(connectedShapeIds)
	} else {
		editor.setHintingShapes([])
	}
})
```

## Visual rendering

Both hover and hint indicators use the same selection color (`--tl-color-selected` CSS variable). The editor renders them using either SVG or canvas depending on the shape's indicator implementation.

| State    | Stroke width | Condition                          |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Selected | 1.5px        | Shape is in selection              |
| Hovered  | 1.5px        | Pointer is over shape (automatic)  |
| Hinted   | 2.5px        | Shape is in hinting array (manual) |

Collaborator selections render at 1.5px with their user color at reduced opacity.

## Page state storage

Hover and hint state are stored in [TLInstancePageState](?), which tracks per-page interaction state. Each page maintains its own hover and hint values.

```typescript
const pageState = editor.getCurrentPageState()

pageState.hoveredShapeId // TLShapeId | null
pageState.hintingShapeIds // TLShapeId[]
```

Both properties are ephemeral—they don't persist across sessions or sync between collaborators.
