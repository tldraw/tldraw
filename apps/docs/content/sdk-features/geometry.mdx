The geometry system provides mathematical representations of shapes for hit testing, bounds calculation, snapping, and collision detection. Every shape in tldraw has geometry that describes its outline, area, and spatial properties. When you brush a selection box across the canvas, click to select a shape, or snap an arrow to a shape's edge, the geometry system handles the underlying math. For the broader shape system, see [Shapes](/docs/shapes).

## How geometry works

Each ShapeUtil implements a `getGeometry` method that returns a `Geometry2d` instance describing the shape's mathematical form. The editor calls this method whenever it needs to know a shape's bounds, test if a point hits the shape, find intersection points, or calculate distances.

```typescript
class MyShapeUtil extends ShapeUtil<MyShape> {
	getGeometry(shape: MyShape): Geometry2d {
		return new Rectangle2d({
			width: shape.props.w,
			height: shape.props.h,
			isFilled: true,
		})
	}
}
```

The `isFilled` property matters for hit testing. A filled geometry counts clicks inside its area as hits. An unfilled geometry only responds to clicks on its outline.

## Geometry primitives

The SDK includes geometry classes for common shapes.

### Rectangle2d

Axis-aligned rectangles. The most common geometry for box-shaped elements.

```typescript
new Rectangle2d({
	width: 200,
	height: 100,
	isFilled: true,
})
```

You can offset the rectangle from the origin:

```typescript
new Rectangle2d({
	x: 10,
	y: 10,
	width: 200,
	height: 100,
	isFilled: true,
})
```

### Ellipse2d

Circles and ellipses.

```typescript
new Ellipse2d({
	width: 100,
	height: 100, // circle
	isFilled: true,
})

new Ellipse2d({
	width: 200,
	height: 100, // ellipse
	isFilled: true,
})
```

### Circle2d

A specialized circle geometry that stores radius directly. The `x` and `y` parameters offset the circle's bounding box, not its center.

```typescript
new Circle2d({
	radius: 50,
	isFilled: true,
})

// Offset from origin
new Circle2d({
	x: 10,
	y: 10,
	radius: 50,
	isFilled: true,
})
```

### Polygon2d

Arbitrary closed polygons defined by vertices.

```typescript
new Polygon2d({
	points: [new Vec(0, 50), new Vec(100, 0), new Vec(100, 100), new Vec(0, 100)],
	isFilled: true,
})
```

Polygon2d requires at least three points and automatically closes the path.

### Polyline2d

Open paths defined by vertices. Use this for lines that don't form closed shapes. Requires at least two points.

```typescript
new Polyline2d({
	points: [new Vec(0, 0), new Vec(50, 100), new Vec(100, 0)],
})
```

Polylines are never filled since they don't enclose an area. Polygon2d extends Polyline2d but sets `isClosed` to true.

### Edge2d

A single line segment between two points.

```typescript
new Edge2d({
	start: new Vec(0, 0),
	end: new Vec(100, 100),
})
```

Arrows use Edge2d for straight arrow bodies.

### Arc2d

A circular arc defined by center, start, end, and arc flags. All parameters are required.

```typescript
new Arc2d({
	center: new Vec(50, 50),
	start: new Vec(0, 50),
	end: new Vec(100, 50),
	sweepFlag: 1,
	largeArcFlag: 0,
})
```

The `sweepFlag` and `largeArcFlag` follow SVG arc conventions: `sweepFlag` controls clockwise vs counterclockwise direction, and `largeArcFlag` chooses between the two possible arcs. Arrows use Arc2d for curved arrow bodies.

### Stadium2d

A pill or capsule shape (rectangle with semicircular ends). The shorter dimension determines the radius of the rounded ends.

```typescript
new Stadium2d({
	width: 200,
	height: 50,
	isFilled: true,
})
```

### CubicBezier2d

A single cubic bezier curve segment.

```typescript
new CubicBezier2d({
	start: new Vec(0, 0),
	cp1: new Vec(30, 100),
	cp2: new Vec(70, 100),
	end: new Vec(100, 0),
})
```

### CubicSpline2d

A smooth curve through multiple points, automatically generating smooth cubic bezier segments between them.

```typescript
new CubicSpline2d({
	points: [new Vec(0, 0), new Vec(50, 100), new Vec(100, 50), new Vec(150, 100)],
})
```

### Point2d

A single point with a hit margin. Both `point` and `margin` are required.

```typescript
new Point2d({
	point: new Vec(50, 50),
	margin: 10,
})
```

### Group2d

Combines multiple geometries into a single composite geometry. The children don't need to be the same type.

```typescript
new Group2d({
	children: [
		new Rectangle2d({ width: 100, height: 80, isFilled: true }),
		new Circle2d({ x: 50, y: -20, radius: 20, isFilled: true }),
	],
})
```

Group2d is essential for shapes with multiple parts. The geo shape uses it to combine its outline with its label bounds. The arrow shape uses it to combine the arrow body with its label.

## Geometry operations

All Geometry2d classes provide methods for spatial queries.

### Bounds

Get the axis-aligned bounding box:

```typescript
const geometry = editor.getShapeGeometry(shape)
const bounds = geometry.bounds // Box { x, y, w, h, ... }
```

### Vertices

Get the points that define the geometry's outline:

```typescript
const vertices = geometry.vertices // Vec[]
```

For curves, this returns a discretized approximation.

### Hit testing

Test if a point hits the geometry:

```typescript
geometry.hitTestPoint(point, margin, hitInside)
```

The `margin` expands the hit area. The `hitInside` parameter controls whether points inside unfilled shapes count as hits.

Test if a line segment intersects the geometry:

```typescript
geometry.hitTestLineSegment(A, B, distance)
```

### Distance and intersection

Find the nearest point on the geometry to a given point:

```typescript
const nearest = geometry.nearestPoint(point)
```

Get the distance from a point to the geometry:

```typescript
const distance = geometry.distanceToPoint(point)
```

Negative distances mean the point is inside a filled geometry.

Get intersection points with a line segment:

```typescript
const intersections = geometry.intersectLineSegment(A, B)
```

### Length and interpolation

Get the perimeter length:

```typescript
const length = geometry.length
```

Find a point at a fraction along the edge:

```typescript
const point = geometry.interpolateAlongEdge(0.5) // midpoint
```

Convert a point back to a fraction:

```typescript
const t = geometry.uninterpolateAlongEdge(point)
```

## Implementing getGeometry

The `getGeometry` method receives the shape and returns geometry in shape-local coordinates (origin at top-left of shape).

### Simple shapes

For shapes with a single outline:

```typescript
getGeometry(shape: MyShape) {
	return new Rectangle2d({
		width: shape.props.w,
		height: shape.props.h,
		isFilled: shape.props.fill !== 'none',
	})
}
```

### Shapes with labels

Shapes that have text labels typically return a Group2d with the main geometry and a label rectangle:

```typescript
getGeometry(shape: MyShape) {
	const outline = new Rectangle2d({
		width: shape.props.w,
		height: shape.props.h,
		isFilled: shape.props.fill !== 'none',
	})

	const label = new Rectangle2d({
		x: labelX,
		y: labelY,
		width: labelWidth,
		height: labelHeight,
		isFilled: true,
		isLabel: true,
	})

	return new Group2d({
		children: [outline, label],
	})
}
```

The `isLabel` property marks geometry that represents text labels. This affects filtering in some operations.

### Custom polygons

For non-rectangular shapes, calculate vertices and use Polygon2d:

```typescript
getGeometry(shape: HouseShape) {
	const { w, h } = shape.props
	const roofPeak = h * 0.3

	return new Polygon2d({
		points: [
			new Vec(0, roofPeak),
			new Vec(w / 2, 0),
			new Vec(w, roofPeak),
			new Vec(w, h),
			new Vec(0, h),
		],
		isFilled: true,
	})
}
```

### Composite shapes

For shapes with multiple distinct parts:

```typescript
getGeometry(shape: HouseShape) {
	const house = new Polygon2d({
		points: getHouseVertices(shape),
		isFilled: true,
	})

	const door = new Rectangle2d({
		x: shape.props.w / 2 - 15,
		y: shape.props.h - 40,
		width: 30,
		height: 40,
		isFilled: true,
	})

	return new Group2d({
		children: [house, door],
	})
}
```

## Geometry caching

The editor caches geometry computations. Without caching, dragging a selection box over hundreds of shapes would recompute each shape's geometry on every frame.

Access cached geometry through the editor:

```typescript
const geometry = editor.getShapeGeometry(shape)
const pageBounds = editor.getShapePageBounds(shape)
```

The cache invalidates automatically when shape props change. You don't need to manage invalidation yourself.

## Geometry filtering

Group2d supports filtering to include or exclude certain geometry children during operations. This lets you mark parts of a shape's geometry for different purposes.

The `isLabel` flag marks geometry that represents text label bounds. Label geometry participates in click-to-edit detection but is typically excluded from outline calculations and snapping.

The `isInternal` flag marks geometry that exists for internal calculations but shouldn't be part of the shape's visible outline.

```typescript
// Mark geometry as a label
new Rectangle2d({
	// ...
	isLabel: true,
})

// Mark geometry as internal (not part of main outline)
new Rectangle2d({
	// ...
	isInternal: true,
})
```

The geometry system provides filter presets for common scenarios:

| Filter                 | Includes labels | Includes internal |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `EXCLUDE_NON_STANDARD` | No              | No                |
| `INCLUDE_ALL`          | Yes             | Yes               |
| `EXCLUDE_LABELS`       | No              | Yes               |
| `EXCLUDE_INTERNAL`     | Yes             | No                |

Most operations use `EXCLUDE_NON_STANDARD` by default, which gives you the shape's main outline without labels or internal geometry.

## Advanced options

Geometry2d has additional options for special cases.

### excludeFromShapeBounds

When set, the geometry won't contribute to the shape's bounding box calculation. The geometry still participates in hit testing and other operations, but `getBoundsVertices()` returns an empty array for it.

```typescript
const label = new Rectangle2d({
	x: labelX,
	y: labelY,
	width: labelWidth,
	height: labelHeight,
	isFilled: true,
	isLabel: true,
	excludeFromShapeBounds: true, // label won't affect shape bounds
})
```

This is useful for labels and other auxiliary geometry that shouldn't change the shape's overall size.

### ignore

When set on geometry inside a Group2d, that geometry is placed in an `ignoredChildren` array and won't participate in the group's operations like hit testing, bounds calculation, or rendering.

```typescript
new Group2d({
	children: [
		mainGeometry,
		new Rectangle2d({
			// ...
			ignore: true, // won't participate in group operations
		}),
	],
})
```

### debugColor

A color string used when rendering geometry in the debug view. Defaults to red if not specified.

```typescript
new Rectangle2d({
	width: 100,
	height: 100,
	isFilled: true,
	debugColor: 'blue', // shows as blue in geometry debugging view
})
```

Enable the geometry debug view through the debug panel to visualize shape geometry during development.

## Transformed geometry

The `TransformedGeometry2d` class wraps a geometry with a transformation matrix. This is useful when you need geometry in a different coordinate space without creating new geometry objects.

```typescript
const transformed = geometry.transform(matrix)
```

All operations on the transformed geometry apply the transformation automatically.

## Key files

The geometry primitives live in `packages/editor/src/lib/primitives/geometry/`. Each class has its own file:

- `Geometry2d.ts` - Base class and TransformedGeometry2d
- `Rectangle2d.ts`, `Circle2d.ts`, `Ellipse2d.ts`, `Polygon2d.ts`
- `Polyline2d.ts`, `Edge2d.ts`, `Arc2d.ts`, `Stadium2d.ts`
- `CubicBezier2d.ts`, `CubicSpline2d.ts`, `Point2d.ts`, `Group2d.ts`

For snapping behavior, see `packages/editor/src/lib/editor/managers/SnapManager/`.
