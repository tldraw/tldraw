The editor uses three coordinate systems: screen space, viewport space, and page space. When you move the mouse over the canvas, the browser gives you screen coordinates. To create a shape at that location, you need to convert those coordinates to page space.

The editor provides methods to convert between these coordinate systems. You'll use these when building custom tools, positioning DOM overlays, or responding to pointer events.

## The three coordinate systems

### Screen space

Screen space uses pixel coordinates from the browser window's top-left corner. These are the values you get from `MouseEvent.clientX` and `MouseEvent.clientY`. Screen coordinates include any space outside the editor container, like browser chrome or other page content.

### Viewport space

Viewport space uses pixel coordinates from the editor container's top-left corner. This accounts for where the editor sits on the page. If the editor is embedded in a scrollable element or positioned away from the browser's origin, viewport coordinates differ from screen coordinates by that offset.

The editor tracks the container's position in `editor.getViewportScreenBounds()`.

### Page space

Page space is the infinite canvas itself. A shape at `x: 100, y: 200` stays at those coordinates regardless of how the user pans or zooms. All shape positions are stored in page space.

The camera determines which part of page space is visible. When you zoom in, the same page-space region takes up more screen pixels. When you pan, different page-space coordinates come into view.

## Coordinate transformations

### Screen to page space

Use `editor.screenToPage()` to convert screen coordinates to page coordinates:

```typescript
// Convert mouse event coordinates to page space
const pagePoint = editor.screenToPage({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY })

// Create a shape at the clicked location
editor.createShape({
	type: 'geo',
	x: pagePoint.x,
	y: pagePoint.y,
	props: { w: 100, h: 100, geo: 'rectangle' },
})
```

This is the most common transformation. It accounts for the editor container's position, the camera position, and the zoom level.

### Page to screen space

Use `editor.pageToScreen()` to convert page coordinates to screen coordinates:

```typescript
// Convert shape position to screen coordinates
const shape = editor.getShape(shapeId)
const screenPoint = editor.pageToScreen({ x: shape.x, y: shape.y })

// Position a DOM element at the shape's screen location
element.style.left = `${screenPoint.x}px`
element.style.top = `${screenPoint.y}px`
```

Use this when positioning DOM elements relative to shapes on the canvas.

### Page to viewport space

Use `editor.pageToViewport()` to convert page coordinates to viewport coordinates:

```typescript
// Get viewport coordinates for a page point
const viewportPoint = editor.pageToViewport({ x: 500, y: 300 })

// Check if a point is visible in the viewport
const viewportBounds = editor.getViewportScreenBounds()
const isVisible =
	viewportPoint.x >= 0 &&
	viewportPoint.x <= viewportBounds.w &&
	viewportPoint.y >= 0 &&
	viewportPoint.y <= viewportBounds.h
```

This is like `pageToScreen()` but relative to the editor container rather than the browser window. Use this for canvas rendering or when you don't care about the editor's position on the page.

## Viewport bounds

Use `editor.getViewportScreenBounds()` to get the editor container's position and size in screen space:

```typescript
const screenBounds = editor.getViewportScreenBounds()
// screenBounds.x, screenBounds.y - container position in screen space
// screenBounds.w, screenBounds.h - container dimensions in pixels
```

Use `editor.getViewportPageBounds()` to get the visible area in page space:

```typescript
const pageBounds = editor.getViewportPageBounds()
// pageBounds.x, pageBounds.y - top-left corner of visible area in page space
// pageBounds.w, pageBounds.h - visible area dimensions in page units
```

The page bounds change when the user pans or zooms. At higher zoom levels, the visible page-space area is smaller.

## Using the inputs manager

The editor's inputs manager tracks the current pointer position in both coordinate systems. This is useful when you need to access the pointer position from anywhere in your code:

```typescript
// Get the current pointer position
const screenPoint = editor.inputs.getCurrentScreenPoint()
const pagePoint = editor.inputs.getCurrentPagePoint()

// Get the position where the current drag started
const originScreenPoint = editor.inputs.getOriginScreenPoint()
const originPagePoint = editor.inputs.getOriginPagePoint()
```

In custom tools, you can also convert the event's `point` property (which is in screen space) to page space:

```typescript
editor.on('event', (event) => {
	if (event.type === 'pointer' && event.name === 'pointer_down') {
		const pagePoint = editor.screenToPage(event.point)
		// Use pagePoint for shape manipulation
	}
})
```

### Positioning custom overlays

To position a DOM element over a shape, convert the shape's page coordinates to screen coordinates. Then subtract the viewport's screen position to get coordinates relative to the editor container:

```typescript
const shape = editor.getShape(shapeId)
const screenBounds = editor.getViewportScreenBounds()
const screenPoint = editor.pageToScreen({ x: shape.x, y: shape.y })

// Position relative to the editor container
overlay.style.left = `${screenPoint.x - screenBounds.x}px`
overlay.style.top = `${screenPoint.y - screenBounds.y}px`
```
