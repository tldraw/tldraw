Focus determines whether the editor receives keyboard shortcuts, scroll wheel gestures, and certain pointer events. When focused, these inputs go to the editor. When unfocused, they pass through to the rest of your page.

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw
				autoFocus={true}
				onMount={(editor) => {
					// Focus the editor after a sidebar closes
					document.getElementById('sidebar-close')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
						editor.focus()
					})
				}}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

## Controlling focus

You can programmatically control focus using the `focus()` and `blur()` methods:

```typescript
// Focus the editor
editor.focus()

// Unfocus the editor
editor.blur()

// Check if the editor is focused
const isFocused = editor.getIsFocused()
```

Both methods accept options to control whether the container element should also receive or lose DOM focus:

```typescript
// Focus the editor without changing container focus
editor.focus({ focusContainer: false })

// Blur the editor without changing container focus
editor.blur({ blurContainer: false })
```

## How focus state works

The editor tracks focus separately from the browser's DOM focus. While the container element can receive DOM focus through normal browser mechanisms, the editor maintains its own focus state in the instance record's `isFocused` property. This separation lets you distinguish between "editor focus" (whether the editor should respond to keyboard shortcuts) and "element focus" (which HTML element is active).

When `isFocused` changes, the `FocusManager` adds or removes the `tl-container__focused` CSS class on the container. This class is necessary because the editor's focus state and DOM focus aren't always identical, making `:focus` or `:focus-within` pseudo-selectors unreliable.

## Auto-focus

The `autoFocus` prop controls whether the editor focuses when it mounts. It defaults to `true`.

```tsx
// Editor will be focused when it mounts
<Tldraw autoFocus={true} />

// Editor will not be focused when it mounts
<Tldraw autoFocus={false} />
```

## Focus ring visibility

Separately from focus state, the editor manages focus ring visibility for accessibility. Focus rings are the browser's outline that appears around focused elements.

The editor hides focus rings during mouse interactions but shows them during keyboard navigation. Pressing Tab, ArrowUp, or ArrowDown removes the `tl-container__no-focus-ring` class to show focus rings. Mouse clicks add the class back to hide them. During shape editing, focus rings stay hidden.

## Completing interactions on blur

When you call `editor.blur()`, it first calls `editor.complete()` to finish any ongoing interaction like a drag or draw operation. This prevents the editor from being left in an incomplete state when focus is lost.
