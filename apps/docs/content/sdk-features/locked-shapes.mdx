Locked shapes can't be selected, moved, resized, edited, or deleted through normal interactions. Lock a shape when you want it to stay exactly where it is: background elements, reference images, or layout guides that shouldn't move while you work on other parts of the canvas.

## The isLocked property

Every [shape](/docs/shapes) has an `isLocked` boolean property. When `true`, the shape is protected from most modifications:

```typescript
// Create a locked shape
editor.createShape({
	type: 'geo',
	x: 100,
	y: 100,
	isLocked: true,
	props: { w: 200, h: 150, geo: 'rectangle' },
})

// Check if a shape is locked
const shape = editor.getShape(shapeId)
if (shape.isLocked) {
	// Shape is locked
}
```

## Toggling lock state

Use [Editor#toggleLock](?) to flip the lock state of shapes. If shapes have mixed lock states, they all become locked:

```typescript
// Lock selected shapes
editor.toggleLock(editor.getSelectedShapeIds())

// Lock specific shapes by ID
editor.toggleLock([shapeId1, shapeId2])
```

When you lock shapes that were all previously unlocked, they automatically deselect. This prevents accidentally manipulating them while they're protected.

## What locking prevents

Locked shapes resist most operations:

| Operation    | Behavior                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Selection    | Clicking a locked shape doesn't select it. Brush selection and [Editor#selectAll](?) skip locked shapes. |
| Movement     | Pointer drags pass through locked shapes to the canvas.                                                  |
| Modification | [Editor#updateShape](?) calls on locked shapes are ignored.                                              |
| Deletion     | [Editor#deleteShapes](?) skips locked shapes.                                                            |
| Grouping     | Locked shapes can't be added to groups.                                                                  |
| Editing      | Double-clicking a locked shape doesn't enter edit mode.                                                  |

## Ancestor locking

Lock state inherits through the shape hierarchy. If a shape's ancestor is locked, the shape behaves as locked too. Check this with [Editor#isShapeOrAncestorLocked](?):

```typescript
// True if the shape or any of its parents is locked
const isProtected = editor.isShapeOrAncestorLocked(shape)
```

Locking a frame or group protects all its children without needing to lock each shape individually.

## Bypassing locks programmatically

Sometimes you need to modify locked shapes from code: migrations, admin tools, or automated operations. Wrap your operations in [Editor#run](?) with `ignoreShapeLock: true`:

```typescript
editor.run(
	() => {
		// These operations affect locked shapes
		editor.updateShape({ id: lockedShapeId, type: 'geo', x: 200 })
		editor.deleteShapes([lockedShapeId])
	},
	{ ignoreShapeLock: true }
)
```

This bypasses the lock check for all operations inside the callback. Use it carefully since the lock exists to protect shapes from unintended changes.

Even with `ignoreShapeLock: true`, some behaviors remain unchanged: locked shapes still can't be selected by clicking, pointer events still pass through to the canvas, and `selectAll()` still skips locked shapes. The flag affects store operations (create, update, delete), not the selection and interaction model.

## Shapes that can be edited while locked

Some shapes have interactive content that should remain usable even when locked. Embed shapes (YouTube videos, Figma files, interactive maps) are a good example: you might want the embed locked in place but still playable or navigable.

[ShapeUtils](/docs/shapes#shapeutils) can override [ShapeUtil#canEditWhileLocked](?) to allow editing interactions on locked shapes:

```typescript
class MyInteractiveShapeUtil extends ShapeUtil<MyShape> {
	override canEditWhileLocked(shape: MyShape): boolean {
		return true
	}
}
```

When this returns `true`, double-clicking the locked shape enters edit mode, letting users interact with the shape's content without being able to move or resize it.

## Locking in the UI

In the default tldraw UI, users can lock shapes through the context menu or the keyboard shortcut (`Shift+L`). Locked shapes display a lock indicator when hovered, and the context menu shows an unlock option.
