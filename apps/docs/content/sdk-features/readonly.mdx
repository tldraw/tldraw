Readonly mode turns the editor into a viewer. Users can pan, zoom, and select shapes to inspect them, but they can't create, modify, or delete anything. Use readonly mode when you want to display canvas content without allowing changes—embedding documents in a presentation, sharing a design for feedback, or showing a preview of saved work.

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from 'tldraw'
import 'tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function ReadOnlyViewer() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw
				onMount={(editor) => {
					editor.updateInstanceState({ isReadonly: true })
				}}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

## Enabling readonly mode

Readonly state lives in the editor's instance state. Toggle it with `updateInstanceState`:

```typescript
// Enable readonly mode
editor.updateInstanceState({ isReadonly: true })

// Disable readonly mode
editor.updateInstanceState({ isReadonly: false })

// Check current state
const isReadonly = editor.getIsReadonly()
```

The state persists across sessions when you use a `persistenceKey`. A document saved in readonly mode opens in readonly mode.

## What readonly mode blocks

When readonly is enabled, the editor prevents all document mutations. These operations return early without making changes:

- **Shape operations**: `createShape`, `createShapes`, `deleteShapes`, `updateShape`, `groupShapes`, `ungroupShapes`
- **Page operations**: `createPage`, `deletePage`, `renamePage`, `moveShapesToPage`
- **Asset operations**: `createAssets`, `updateAssets`, `deleteAssets`
- **Transform operations**: `flipShapes`, `packShapes`, `alignShapes`, `distributeShapes`, `rotateShapes`, `resizeShape`
- **Style operations**: `setStyleForSelectedShapes`, `setOpacityForSelectedShapes`, `setOpacityForNextShapes`
- **Clipboard operations**: `cut`, and `paste` for external content
- **History operations**: `undo`, `redo`

The toolbar automatically hides editing tools. Only the select tool, hand tool, and laser pointer remain visible.

## What readonly mode allows

Navigation and viewing operations work normally:

- **Camera control**: Panning, zooming, `zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `zoomToFit`, `zoomToSelection`
- **Selection**: Clicking shapes, brush selection, `selectAll`, `selectNone`
- **Viewing**: Hovering shapes, inspecting properties
- **Export**: `exportAs`, `copyAs` (exporting the document doesn't modify it)
- **Page navigation**: Switching between pages

## Using the useReadonly hook

In React components, the `useReadonly` hook provides reactive access to the readonly state:

```tsx
import { useReadonly, useEditor } from 'tldraw'

function ReadonlyIndicator() {
	const isReadonly = useReadonly()

	if (!isReadonly) return null

	return <div className="readonly-badge">View only</div>
}
```

The component re-renders automatically when readonly state changes.

## Actions in readonly mode

Actions have a `readonlyOk` property that determines whether they work in readonly mode. When an action has `readonlyOk: false` (the default), triggering it in readonly mode does nothing.

Actions that work in readonly mode include:

- Zoom controls: `zoom-in`, `zoom-out`, `zoom-to-fit`, `zoom-to-selection`
- Selection: `select-all`, `select-none`, `copy`
- Export: `export-as-svg`, `export-as-png`, `print`
- Navigation: `back-to-content`, `change-page-prev`, `change-page-next`

When defining custom actions, set `readonlyOk: true` if the action should work in readonly mode:

```typescript
const overrides: TLUiOverrides = {
	actions(editor, actions, helpers) {
		actions['share-link'] = {
			id: 'share-link',
			label: 'action.share-link',
			readonlyOk: true,
			onSelect() {
				// This works in readonly mode
				navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href)
			},
		}
		return actions
	},
}
```

## Shapes that remain interactive

Some shapes have interactive content that should work even when the document is readonly. Embed shapes—YouTube videos, Figma files, interactive maps—are a good example. The embed itself is locked in place, but users can still play videos or interact with the embedded content.

ShapeUtils can override `canEditInReadonly` to allow editing interactions on their shapes:

```typescript
class InteractiveWidgetUtil extends ShapeUtil<InteractiveWidget> {
	canEditInReadonly(shape: InteractiveWidget): boolean {
		return true
	}
}
```

When this returns `true`, double-clicking the shape enters edit mode even in readonly mode. The shape's interactive content becomes usable while the shape itself stays fixed.

## Forcing operations in readonly mode

For programmatic use cases like migrations or admin tools, you can bypass the readonly check by passing `force: true` to certain operations:

```typescript
// This works even in readonly mode
editor.putExternalContent(
	{ type: 'files', files: [...], point: { x: 0, y: 0 } },
	{ force: true }
)
```

Not all methods support this option. Use it sparingly—readonly mode exists to prevent unintended changes.

## Collaboration and readonly mode

When using tldraw's sync packages for collaboration, readonly mode integrates with room permissions. A user with read-only access to a shared document sees the editor in readonly mode automatically. The sync layer sets `isReadonly: true` based on the user's role.

```typescript
// The sync layer handles this internally
editor.updateInstanceState({
	isReadonly: collaborationMode === 'readonly',
})
```

Changes from other collaborators still appear—the document updates in real time—but the readonly user can't contribute changes themselves.
