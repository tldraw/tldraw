Starter Kits are application templates built on top of the tldraw SDK. They provide implementations of common canvas-based use cases, including frontend components and starting points for backend infrastructure and deployment configuration.

---

## Starter Kit Benefits

- **Customizable UI**: All components use standard tldraw APIs so you can add custom shapes, tools, and change the UI.
- **Extensible foundation**: Built on the same reactive architecture powering the [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com) whiteboard.
- **Scalable infrastructure**: easy integrations for real-time collaboration, asset management, and error handling.

## Try it yourself

Run this command in your terminal to build with starter kits:

```jsx
npm create tldraw@latest
```
