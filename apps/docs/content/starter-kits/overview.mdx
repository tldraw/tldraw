Starter kits are complete applications built on tldraw. Each one includes frontend components, backend infrastructure, and deployment configuration—everything you need to ship a canvas-based product.

```bash
npm create tldraw@latest
```

### [Multiplayer](/starter-kits/multiplayer)

![Multiplayer starter kit](/images/starter-kit-images/multiplayer-starter.avif)

Self-hosted tldraw with real-time collaboration. Uses [tldraw sync](/docs/sync) and Cloudflare Durable Objects for the backend—deploy your own multiplayer whiteboard.

### [Agent](/starter-kits/agent)

![Agent starter kit](/images/starter-kit-images/agent-starter.avif)

Let AI agents read and write to your canvas. The agent can interpret drawings, generate diagrams, and manipulate shapes based on natural language.

### [Workflow](/starter-kits/workflow)

![Workflow starter kit](/images/starter-kit-images/workflow-starter.avif)

A node-based editor with drag-and-drop nodes, automatic edge routing, and execution controls. Build automation tools, data pipelines, or visual programming environments.

### [Chat](/starter-kits/chat)

![Chat starter kit](/images/starter-kit-images/chat-starter.avif)

A canvas for sketching and annotation before sending to AI. Draw diagrams, mark up images, or sketch ideas—then send the whole canvas as context.

### [Shader](/starter-kits/shader)

![Shader starter kit](/images/starter-kit-images/shader-starter.avif)

WebGL shaders that respond to canvas interactions. The background reacts to panning, zooming, and shape positions. A starting point for tools with custom visual effects.

### [Branching chat](/starter-kits/branching-chat)

![Branching chat starter kit](/images/starter-kit-images/branching-chat-starter.avif)

A visual conversation tree where each message can branch into multiple paths. Explore different responses, compare outcomes, or build interactive storytelling tools.
