Starter kits provide example implementations of common canvas-based use cases. Use them to prototype ideas or as the foundation for new projects. The source code is yours to hack on.

---

## Create with tldraw

You can access starter kits using the `npm create tldraw@latest` command:

```bash
npm create tldraw@latest
```

Or by using a template repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/tldraw/repositories).

## Available kits

### [Workflow](/starter-kits/workflow)

Build visual tools where users drag, connect and execute nodes to build automation pipelines within a canvas interface. Set up your first workflow builder in minutes, then customize nodes and behaviors for your specific use case. Drag-and-drop nodes, automatic connection routing, and execution management out of the box.
