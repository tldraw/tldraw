Build with our production-ready starter kits. Ship faster, customize everything.

---

## Jump start

Starter kits provide implementations of common canvas-based use cases, including frontend components and starting points for backend infrastructure and deployment configuration. Get started as easy as this:

```bash
npm create tldraw@latest
```

---

## Available Starter Kits

### [Workflow](/starter-kits/workflow)

Build visual tools where users drag, connect and execute nodes to build automation pipelines within a canvas interface. Set up your first workflow builder in minutes, then customize nodes and behaviors for your specific use case. Drag-and-drop nodes, automatic connection routing, and execution management out of the box.
