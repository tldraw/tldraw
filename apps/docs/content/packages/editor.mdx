`@tldraw/editor` is the core canvas engine without default shapes, tools, or UI. Use it when you need a fully custom editor built on tldraw's rendering and interaction model.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @tldraw/editor
```

```typescript
import '@tldraw/editor/editor.css'
```

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { TldrawEditor } from '@tldraw/editor'
import '@tldraw/editor/editor.css'

function App() {
	return <TldrawEditor shapeUtils={[]} tools={[]} />
}
```

## Documentation todos

The following topics should be documented:

- **Instance state** - The `TLInstance` record tracks per-editor state like current page, camera, and UI mode. Instance page state (`TLInstancePageState`) tracks per-page state like selection, hovered shape, and editing shape.
- **Locking** - Shapes can be locked to prevent modification. The `toggleLock()` method changes lock state, and `isShapeOrAncestorLocked()` checks if a shape or its parent is locked.
- **Visibility** - The `getShapeVisibility` option and `isShapeHidden()` method control whether shapes are visible or hidden from rendering and interaction.
- **Snapshots** - The `getSnapshot()` and `loadSnapshot()` methods serialize and restore the entire editor state, useful for persistence and collaboration.
