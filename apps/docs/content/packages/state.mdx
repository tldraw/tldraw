`@tldraw/state` is a signals-based reactive state library. It provides atoms for mutable state, computed values for derived state, and transactions for batching updates.

## Basic usage

```typescript
import { atom, computed, transact } from '@tldraw/state'

const count = atom('count', 0)
const doubled = computed('doubled', () => count.get() * 2)

transact(() => {
	count.set(2)
})
```

## Key concepts

- Automatic dependency tracking
- Lazy recomputation of computed values
- Epoch-based change detection
