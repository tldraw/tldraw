## v3.9.0

This release focuses on bug fixes and performance enhancements, laying groundwork for v3.10 features.

### Breaking changes

- `store.createSelectedComputedCache` removed; use `store.createCache` with custom selector `computed` instead
- `createComputerCache` API modified: third argument now accepts options object with `areRecordsEqual` and `areResultsEqual` properties instead of single equality function

### Improvements

- Improve layout operations including align, distribute, flip, and stack with better compatibility for arrows and overlapping shapes
- Add new `AtomMap` class to accelerate shape, binding, and record creation/deletion, available as a utility for building custom reactive maps
- Add horizontal padding to text-bound arrows for improved visual appearance

### Bug fixes

- Improve pasted image size calculations
- Remove `canvas-size` dependency resolving bundler compatibility issues
- Correct SVG copy mimetype
- Fix text shape cloning crash
- Restore temporary image preview display during uploads
- Recognize `https://localhost` as development environment for licensing
