## v3.5.0

This release introduces enhancements to grid snapping during shape creation, improves layering mechanics, and provides better control over export functionality.

### Improvements

- Add automatic grid alignment when shapes are drawn with new `maybeSnapToGrid` function, enabling snapping for both click-created and drag-created shapes when grid mode is active ([#4894](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4894))
- Improve "bring forward" and "send backward" actions by making them only consider nearby overlapping shapes ([#4898](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4898))
- Improve panning performance for note-heavy canvases and zoomed-out views
- Improve page menu hover interaction
- Add custom React provider support in SVG exports
- Switch default theme to light mode
- Improve frame heading right-click behavior

### API changes

- Add `scale` and `pixelRatio` parameters to export utilities for more precise control over export dimensions and quality
- Expose font size and stroke size APIs
- Add socket close reason for rate limiting
- Add option to toggle double-click text creation

### Bug fixes

- Prevent off-screen shape zoom-to-edit
- Resolve erasing state stickiness
- Fix frame heading drag interactions
- Address Safari sleep-related crashes
