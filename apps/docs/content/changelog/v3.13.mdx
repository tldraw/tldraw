## v3.13.0

This release introduces elbow arrows for technical diagramming and continues accessibility improvements toward WCAG compliance.

### Elbow arrows

The arrow shape now supports a new elbow connector style. These arrows travel between points using straight lines joined at right angles rather than curved paths, making them ideal for technical diagrams. Access this option through the arrow tool's line style settings.

### Breaking changes

- `ShapeUtil.canEditInReadOnly` renamed to `ShapeUtil.canEditInReadonly` (note capitalization change)
- Arrow target highlights migrated from `setHintingShapes` to a custom `TldrawOverlays` component; users of `<TldrawEditor />` must pass this component to the `Overlays` slot

### API changes

- Add text measurement API that accepts arbitrary style parameters
- Add new `Overlays` component for camera-following canvas overlays
- Add `hasCustomTabBehavior` prop to `RichTextLabel` for custom tab logic

### Improvements

- Link text auto-selects when editing shape links
- Pasted text and embeds snap to grid when enabled
- Figma embeds now work with selection links
- Arrow label editing shows a visual block indicating label placement
- Single frame exports now include background color
- Frames can be double-click resized to fit contents
- Style panel now focuses with keyboard shortcut
- More UI icons and handles receive proper labels
- Add container navigation shortcuts for moving selections in/out of frames and groups
- Embed shapes are now keyboard-tabbable
- Toolbars throughout the application support keyboard navigation
- Rich text editing shortcuts appear in the help menu

### Performance

- Significantly faster programmatic rotation of selected shapes
- Substantially accelerated multi-shape dragging operations
- Selection evaluation optimizations prevent unnecessary re-evaluations

### Bug fixes

- Fix flattened shape backgrounds
- Fix screenreader behavior
- Fix tool consistency
- Fix text rendering
- Fix selection accuracy
- Fix arrow flickering during rotation
