This release delivers bug fixes and performance enhancements, including customization options for presence data synchronization.

## What's new

### Presence sync customization ([#5149](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5149))

Developers can now customize what presence data is synced between clients, or disable presence syncing entirely. This enables optimization for high-latency connections and privacy-focused applications.

## API changes

- Allow `expandSelectionOutlinePx` to return a `Box` object to enable asymmetric expansion across different sides.
- Modify behavior when using `editor.updateShape` to properly handle undefined values.

## Bug fixes

- Fix React Strict Mode listener bug affecting `store.listen`.
- Fix image rotation and cropping functionality issues.
- Fix CSS import failures during export/print operations.
- Fix text measurement div leakage during development hot reloads.
- Fix popover menu viewport overflow problems.
- Fix GitHub Gist URL validation.
- Fix image dimension limits for pasted content.
- Fix pages menu and quick actions rendering.
