This release adds 2D canvas rendering for shape indicators, a preference for inverting mouse wheel zoom direction, and improved scribble lifecycle for the laser tool. It also includes various bug fixes for collaborator indicators, hidden shape handling, and sync performance.

### 2D canvas rendering for shape indicators ([#7708](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7708))

Shape indicators (selection outlines, hover states) now render using a 2D canvas instead of SVG elements. This significantly improves performance when selecting or hovering over many shapes, with up to 25x faster rendering in some scenarios.

Custom shapes can opt into canvas indicators by implementing the new `getIndicatorPath()` method on their ShapeUtil:

```tsx
class MyShapeUtil extends ShapeUtil<MyShape> {
	getIndicatorPath(shape: MyShape): TLIndicatorPath | null {
		return {
			path: new Path2D(),
			// optional clip path for complex shapes like arrows with labels
		}
	}

	// Return false to use the new canvas indicators (default is true for backwards compatibility)
	useLegacyIndicator(): boolean {
		return false
	}
}
```

### Invert mouse wheel zoom direction ([#7732](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7732))

Added a new user preference to invert mouse wheel zoom direction. Some users prefer "natural" scrolling behavior where scrolling down zooms out, which this option now enables.

Access it via Menu → Preferences → Input device → Invert mouse zoom.

## API changes

- Add `ShapeUtil.getIndicatorPath()` method and `TLIndicatorPath` type for canvas-based indicator rendering. Add `ShapeUtil.useLegacyIndicator()` to control whether shapes use SVG or canvas indicators. ([#7708](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7708))
- Add `isZoomDirectionInverted` to `TLUserPreferences` interface and `UserPreferencesManager.getIsZoomDirectionInverted()` method. Add `ToggleInvertZoomItem` component export and `toggle-invert-zoom` action. ([#7732](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7732))
- Add `complete` to `TL_SCRIBBLE_STATES` enum and `ScribbleManager.complete(id)` method for marking scribbles as complete before fading. ([#7760](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7760))

## Improvements

- Improve laser pointer strokes with proper taper when lifting the pointer by adding a 'complete' state to the scribble lifecycle. ([#7760](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7760))
- Reduce network traffic by squashing pending push requests before sending, so rapid edits result in fewer network calls. ([#7724](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7724))
- Improve frame label sizing on smaller viewports and when zoomed out. ([#7746](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7746))

## Bug fixes

- Fix `zoomToFit` and `getCurrentPageBounds` to ignore hidden shapes when computing bounds. ([#7770](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7770))
- Fix collaborator shape indicators not rendering after the canvas indicator change. ([#7759](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7759))
- Fix rich text content not updating correctly with message squashing due to reference comparison. ([#7758](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7758))
- Fix keyboard shortcut menu item labels to use consistent ellipsis formatting. ([#7757](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7757))
- Fix spatial index not removing shapes when moved to a different page. ([#7700](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/7700))
