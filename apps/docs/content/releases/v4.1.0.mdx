# tldraw v4.1.0

Welcome to version 4.1.0 of tldraw! This is a maintenance release including a new starter kit, a few minor API additions, and a handful of improvements and bug fixes.

## Shader starter kit (#6847)

We're excited to introduce the **Shader Starter Kit** – a new template that demonstrates how to integrate WebGL shaders with tldraw to create dynamic, interactive backgrounds that respond to canvas interactions. Try it out and read the docs [here](https://tldraw.dev/starter-kits/shader).

### What's included

The starter kit comes with a reusable `WebGLManager` base class and four complete shader examples to get you started:

- **Fluid Simulation** - Real-time Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics that respond to shape movements
- **Rainbow** - Animated gradient effects with time-based animations
- **Shadows** - Dynamic shadow casting from shapes using raymarching and signed distance fields
- **Minimal** - A bare-bones template for starting your own shader projects

Each example includes configurable parameters with a built-in UI panel, localStorage persistence, and full TypeScript support.

### Getting started

Create a new project with the shader starter kit using:

```bash
npm create tldraw@latest
```

Then select "Shader" from the template options. You can also explore the template directly in the repository: [github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/templates/shader](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/templates/shader)

## API Changes

- Allow embed types to opt-out of embed-on-paste behavior ([#6819](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6819)) ([#6874](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6874))

  Adds the `embedOnPaste` option to `EmbedDefinition` to configure whether embeds are paste-able. Opting out means
  that pasting an embeddable URL will insert a bookmark shape instead of the embed shape.

- Omit arrow and lines from the minimap for clearer navigation ([#6327](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6327))

  Adds `hideInMinimap` option to `ShapeUtil` to optionally hide shapes from the minimap.

- Add independent x and y handle snapping ([#6883](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6883))

  Adds a `snapType?: 'point' | 'align'` property to the `TLHandle` class. Deprecates the `canSnap` property.

- Expose `Editor#getShapePageBounds` method and `isRecordsDiffEmpty` helper function([#6871](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6871))

- Adds `localStorageAtom` to `@tldraw/state`. This is an atom backed by `localStorage` with cross-tab syncing ([#6876](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6876))

- Adds inline version of style picker buttons: `StylePanelButtonPickerInline`, `StylePanelDoubleDropdownPickerInline`, and `StylePanelDropdownPickerInline`. Use these components inside of `TldrawUiToolbar` components where needed. ([#6920](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6920))

## Improvements

- Make bookmark titles clickable ([#6326](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6326))

- Improve top bar rendering on mobile ([#6895](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6895))

  Reduces the number of UI elements that are rendered on mobile out of the box.

- Allow using Numpad Enter trigger edit mode on shapes. ([#6830](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6830))

- Consolidate preferences menu groups ([#6802](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6802))

## Bug Fixes

- Fix accessibility shortcut typo ([#6811](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6811))
- Reinstate the focus mode action which was deleted by accident ([#6812](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6812))
- Fix arrow rendering edge case ([#6799](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6799))
- Fix a bug that allow opening a empty window on `a` tag click ([#6817](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6817))
- Fix missing translation key. ([#6826](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6826))
- Fix shape index management race condition. ([#6884](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6884))
- Fixed an edge case bug for shapes that have zero geometry vertices ([#6885](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6885))
- Fixed a bug where the style panel buttons would overflow at certain browser zoom levels ([#6920](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6920))
