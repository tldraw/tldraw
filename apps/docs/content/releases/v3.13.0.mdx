The big new feature in this months release is Elbow Arrows! These connectors supplement our existing arrow shape and are well suited to more technical diagramming type use-cases. We’re also been continuing to work on accessibility in tldraw, and there are plenty of other performance improvements too.

#### Elbow arrows

The arrow shape now supports elbow arrows! Instead of a single straight line or arc, these arrows get from A to B in a series straight lines joined at right angles. Access the new arrow type by selecting the arrow tool, and choosing the new option under the "Line" style.

#### Accessibility features

We’re continuing to work on accessibility in this release, as we make progress towards WCAG compliance.

- You can now focus the style panel with the ⌘⏎ keyboard shortcut. ([#5827](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5827))
- More icons and handles in the UI now have labels. ([#6001](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6001))
- ⌘⇧↓ and ⌘⇧↑ moves the selection in and out of container shapes, like frames and groups. ([#5973](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5973))
- You can now tab into embed shapes. ([#5958](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5958))
- The toolbars throughout tldraw are now keyboard navigable. ([#5872](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5872))
- The shortcuts for rich text editing are shown in the keyboard shortcuts help menu. ([#5912](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5912))

#### Breaking changes

- `ShapeUtil.canEditInReadOnly` has been renamed to `ShapeUtil.canEditInReadonly` - note the case-change on “only”. ([#6019](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6019))
- Arrow target highlights have moved from using `setHintingShapes` to a custom `TldrawOverlays` component. If you're using `<TldrawEditor />` instead of `<Tldraw />`, you need to make sure you're passing this new component in the `Overlays` slot.

#### Improvements

- When editing the link on a shape, link text is now auto-selected for faster editing. ([#6072](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6072))
- Pasted text and embeds are now snapped to the grid if it’s enabled. ([#6020](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6020))
- Figma embed now also work with selection links. ([#6025](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6025))
- When editing an arrow label, we now block off part of the arrow to show where your label will appear. ([#6029](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6029))
- Exports of single frames now have the frame background color included in the export. ([#5993](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5993))
- Standardised gradient and hover effects for open submenu items are standardised across the UI. ([#5974](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5974))
- Frames can now be resized to fit their contents by double-clicking their edges. ([#5967](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5967))

#### API additions

- The text measurement API now accepts arbitrary styles to be applied to the text being measured. ([#6014](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6014))
- A new `Overlays` component lets you add overlays on top of the canvas that still follow the camera. ([#5952](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5952))
- `RichTextLabel` now accepts a `hasCustomTabBehavior` prop to disable our default tabbing logic where needed. ([#5908](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5908))

#### Other improvements

- Improve performance of a programatically rotating shape when it is selected ([#6023](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6023))
- Dragging many shapes at once is now much faster. ([#5821](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5821))
- Errors in tldraw no longer prompt users to open an issue on GitHub, as they were getting confused between tldraw and products that use the SDK. ([#5947](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5947))
- License keys now support VS Code extensions. ([#5940](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5940))

#### Bug fixes

- Screenreader announcements are now only triggered in response to user actions. ([#6041](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6041))
- The hand tool no longer takes pan speed into account, so it’s consistent with middle-mouse/spacebar panning. ([#6024](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6024))
- Empty lines and list in text now render consistently. ([#6013](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6013))
- The escape key now correctly exits the laser tool. ([#6015](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6015))
- Offscreen shapes are now selected correctly while brushing. ([#6004](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6004))
- `ShapeUtil.getGeometry` uses `shape.meta` as part of its cache key, instead of just `shape.props`. ([#5988](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5988))
- Toolbar buttons reflect their active states correctly. ([#5981](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5981))
- The control key gets released properly when wheeling. ([#5983](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5983))
