Welcome to the 3.1.0 release of the tldraw SDK. This is a small release including a couple of new features, a couple of API additions, and some bug fixes.

Special thanks to new contributor Peter Hagen ([@phgn0](https://github.com/phgn0))!

## What's new

### Hiding shapes using the `isShapeHidden` option

There are some cases where it is useful to prevent shapes from being visible or interactive, e.g. to implement simple permissions in a collaborative app.

You can now use the `isShapeHidden` predicate option to prevent shapes from being rendered or from reacting to pointer events. Learn more in the [docs](https://tldraw.dev/docs/editor#Hiding-shapes).

### Directly update data on the tldraw sync server

If you're using [tldraw sync](https://staging.tldraw.dev/docs/sync) for your app, it is now possible to manipulate document data directly on the server using the `updateShapes` method. This can be useful for integrating features with third-party services, e.g. updating a video shape after your CDN has finished processing it.
