Welcome to the 3.4.0 release of the tldraw SDK. This issue fixes a few bugs in our user interface, improves performance around images and videos, and even improves our very secret ability to accept pasted content from [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). See below for the full list of changes.

#### Breaking changes

- The `id` attribute that was present on some shapes in the dom has been removed. There's now a data-shape-id attribute on every shape wrapper that can be used instead. ([#4694](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4694))

#### Improvements

- Clearer tooltip wording in the style panel. ([#4750](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4750))
- Arrow labels no longer have their indictors showing behind them. ([#4749](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4749))
- Limit the page name length in the move to page menu. ([#4747](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4747))
- Improve performance of image/video rendering. ([#4659](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4659))

#### API changes

- Add `labelColor` to note shapes. ([#4724](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4724))
- There are a new set of APIs for working with unique DOM IDs in tldraw components: [`useUniqueSafeId`](https://staging.tldraw.dev/reference/editor/useUniqueSafeId) & [`useSharedSafeId`](https://staging.tldraw.dev/reference/editor/useSharedSafeId). ([#4694](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4694))

#### Bug fixes

- Writing `options` inline in the Tldraw component will no longer cause re-render loops. ([#4762](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4762))
- Make sure toolbar button outlines match the border-radius of the button. ([#4759](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4759))
- Make sure content pasted from Excalidraw keeps the correct color. ([#4752](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4752))
- Don't highlight menu triggers that dont have their submenus open. ([#4710](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4710))
- Pass through the correct event type for drag events. ([#4739](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4739))
- Prevent multiple images accidentally being created when you drop one onto the canvas. ([#4704](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4704))
- Make sure the link indicator is visible on sticky notes. ([#4708](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4708))
- The insert embed dialog now parses URLs correctly. ([#4709](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4709))
- Exports and other tldraw instances no longer can affect how each other are rendered. ([#4694](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4694))
- Show the correct set of menu options in read-only mode. ([#4696](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4696))
