This release introduces the bindings system, camera constraints, and configurable options—major features that unlock new types of applications you can build with tldraw.

## What's new

### Bindings ([#3326](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3326))

Bindings allow you to create relationships between shapes. Our default arrow shapes are a great example: each end of the arrow can bind to another shape. When that shape moves, so does the arrow.

Before this change, arrows were hard-coded into the library. Now, with the bindings system, you can create arrows, constraint systems, visual programming environments, and much more.

Check out the [bindings guide](https://tldraw.dev/docs/editor#Bindings) for more information. ([#3780](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3780)) ([#3797](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3797)) ([#3800](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3800)) ([#3871](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3871))

### Camera constraints ([#3282](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3282))

You can now limit the camera to a fixed area of the canvas. This is useful for creating experiences that don't quite fit the "infinite canvas" paradigm: document annotators, image editors, slideshow creators, and more.

See the [camera constraints guide](https://tldraw.dev/docs/editor#Camera-options) for more information. ([#3747](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3747)) ([#3814](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3814))

### Configurable options ([#3799](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3799))

You can now override many options which were previously hard-coded constants. Pass an `options` prop into the tldraw component to change the maximum number of pages, grid steps, or other previously hard-coded values.

See [`TldrawOptions`](https://tldraw.dev/reference/editor/TldrawOptions) for details. ([#3900](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3900))

### 💥 Undo/redo changes

The history system has been significantly reworked:

1. **History options simplified**: `squashing`, `ephemeral`, and `preserveRedoStack` flags have been consolidated. Use `editor.history.ignore(fn)` or `editor.history.batch(fn, {history: 'record-preserveRedoStack'})` instead.

2. **Automatic recording**: Everything that touches the store is now recorded in undo/redo (unless part of `mergeRemoteChanges`). Use `editor.history.ignore(fn)` for changes you don't want recorded.

3. **Side effects captured**: Changes in side-effects are now captured by undo/redo. Wrap in `editor.history.ignore` for the old behavior.

## API changes

- 💥 **`canBind`** now accepts an options object instead of just the shape. See [`TLShapeUtilCanBindOpts`](https://tldraw.dev/reference/editor/TLShapeUtilCanBindOpts).
- 💥 **`editor.sideEffects.registerBatchCompleteHandler`** replaced with `editor.sideEffects.registerOperationCompleteHandler`. ([#3748](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3748))
- 💥 **`editor.getArrowInfo(shape)`** replaced with `getArrowInfo(editor, shape)`.
- 💥 **`editor.getArrowsBoundTo(shape)`** removed—use `editor.getBindingsToShape(shape, 'arrow')` instead.
- 💥 **Arrow shape `start` and `end` properties** are now always points. Use `getArrowBindings(editor, shape)` to check for bindings.
- 💥 **Types renamed**: `ShapeProps` → `RecordProps`, `ShapePropsType` → `RecordPropsType`, `TLShapePropsMigrations` → `TLPropsMigrations`, `SchemaShapeInfo` → `SchemaPropsInfo`.
- Add `editor.blur` method. ([#3875](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3875))
- Add better defaults for `createTLStore`. ([#3886](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3886))
- Add `getSnapshot` and `loadSnapshot` for easier document persistence. See [State Snapshots](https://tldraw.dev/docs/persistence#State-Snapshots). ([#3811](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3811))
- Add `select` option to `Editor.groupShapes` and `Editor.ungroupShapes`. ([#3690](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3690))
- `InFrontOfTheCanvas` now has access to the editor's UI context. ([#3782](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3782))
- `useEditor` and other context-based hooks now throw an error when used out-of-context. ([#3750](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3750))
- Add `defaultShapeSchemas` for custom multiplayer implementations. ([#3613](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3613))
