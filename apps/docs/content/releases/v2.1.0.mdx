This release includes completely redesigned sticky notes, an overhaul to our migration system, and significant performance improvements.

## What's new

### New stickies ([#3249](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3249))

Sticky notes have been completely redesigned with a fresh look and improved functionality.

### 💥 New migrations ([#3220](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3220))

The migrations system has been overhauled for better reliability and developer experience.

- The `Migrations` type is now called `LegacyMigrations`
- The serialized schema format (returned by `StoreSchema.serialize()` and `Store.getSnapshot()`) has changed
- `compareRecordVersions` and `RecordVersion` have been removed
- `compareSchemas` is gone—use `schema.getMigrationsSince(prevSchema)` instead
- `defineMigrations` has been deprecated. See [updating legacy shape migrations](https://tldraw.dev/docs/persistence#Updating-legacy-shape-migrations-defineMigrations) for upgrade instructions
- `migrate` has been removed

### 💥 Input buffering ([#3223](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3223))

Events are now buffered and sent to state nodes every tick, instead of immediately. This unlocks big performance improvements but could introduce subtle issues with custom tools—make sure to test any custom tools thoroughly.

### 💥 React-powered SVG exports ([#3117](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3117))

If any of your shapes implement `toSvg` for exports, you'll need to replace your implementation with a new version that returns JSX instead of manually constructing SVG DOM nodes.

`editor.getSvg` is deprecated. Use `editor.getSvgElement` or `editor.getSvgString` instead.

### 💥 Component-based toolbar customization ([#3067](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3067))

If you're using the `toolbar` callback to override toolbar items, switch to using the new `Toolbar` component override. See the [custom toolbar example](https://tldraw.dev/examples/ui/custom-toolbar) for details.

## API changes

- 💥 **`getRenderingShapes`** no longer returns `isCulled`—use `getCulledShapes` instead.
- Add `Editor.getStyleForNextShape`. ([#3039](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3039))
- Add `usePreloadAssets` export. ([#3545](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/3545))
