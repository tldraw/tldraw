This release focuses on accessibility improvements and API enhancements, with no breaking changes.

## API changes

- Add new `getShapeVisibility` prop replacing the deprecated `isShapeHidden`, allowing hidden children to override parent visibility states.
- Allow frames to display colorful borders and labels by configuring `FrameShapeUtil` with `showColors: true`.
- Add `Geometry2d` helper methods including `intersectLineSegment`, `intersectCircle`, `transform`, and filtering options.
- Export two Tiptap extensions individually for rich text customization.

## Improvements

- Add keyboard-based selection movement between shapes using Tab and Cmd/Ctrl+Arrow keys.
- Add screen reader announcements for tool and shape selection changes.
- Add keyboard resizing capability via Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Shift with +/- keys.
- Improve semantic HTML5 tags and proper ARIA roles throughout the UI.
- Simplify keyboard shortcut syntax (e.g., `'?!l'` becomes `'alt+shift+l'`).
- Add atomic `Store.mergeRemoteChanges` with correct scope-triggered side effects.
- Add smoother drawing on slower CPUs via `getCoalescedEvents`.
- Add YouTube embed support for time/loop parameters.
- Add optional asset URL overrides for unused Embed shape icons.

## Bug fixes

- Fix Firefox SVG pasting.
- Fix TailwindCSS text export styling.
- Fix image pasting efficiency.
- Fix Miro shape compatibility.
- Fix Safari trackpad zoom.
