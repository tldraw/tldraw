Welcome to tldraw v4.2.0!

This is a minor maintenance release that includes many bug fixes and small API additions, along with a major version bump of our TipTap rich text editor.

## TipTap v3 ([#5717](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/5717))

We've upgraded TipTap from v2 to v3. If you've done any customization to our standard TipTap kit, please refer to TipTap's Guide [How to upgrade Tiptap v2 to v3](https://tiptap.dev/docs/guides/upgrade-tiptap-v2) as to any breaking changes you might experience from a custom homebrew of the rich text editor in tldraw.

## API Changes

- Add `Editor.setTool`/`Editor.removeTool` for dynamically altering the editor's tool state chart. ([#6909](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6909)) ([#7134](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7134))
- Allow using custom socket implementations with `useSync` via a new `connect` option ([#6859](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6859)) (thanks to [@Digital39999](https://github.com/Digital39999) for help on this one)
- Support store queries on nested properties, e.g. props ([#6981](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6981))
- Add `createBookmarkFromUrl` helper function for creating bookmark shapes more easily. ([#6894](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6894))
- Allow handles to specify a custom reference point for shift-modifier angle snapping ([#6987](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6987)) (contributed by [@naaa760](https://github.com/naaa760))
- Add a 'secret' lined-fill style similar to the full-fill style but with visible outlines. Users can select it by pressing `Option+Shift+F`. ([#7034](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7034))
- Add option to pass callback to onInteractionEnd ([#6919](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6919))
- Add `allowReferrer` option to window opening functions ([#7004](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7004))
- Remove broken/defunct Excalidraw embed definition. Existing Excalidraw embed shapes will remain but render as bookmarks. ([#6897](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6897))

## Improvements

- Use window.prompt for renaming frames on mobile ([#6838](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/6838))
- Add string append optimization to sync protocol ([#7007](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7007)) (contributed by [@quasor](https://github.com/quasor))

- Allow using `TldrawEditor` without needing `TldrawUiContextProvider` ([#7053](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7053))
