Welcome to the 3.5.0 release of tldraw. This month's SDK release improves grid snapping, some usability improvements around layering shapes, and more fine-grained controls around exporting.

## What's new

#### Snap to grid when creating shapes ([#4875](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4875))

This PR makes sure that shapes snap to the grid when created. It adds a `maybeSnapToGrid` function, which can be used to push a shape onto the grid if grid mode is enabled, both when click-creating and when drag-creating.

#### Smart `bringForward`/`sendBackward` ([#4851](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4851))

Improved the 'bring forward' and 'send backward' actions by making them only consider nearby overlapping shapes when deciding the next ordering.

#### Better support scale / quality in export utilities ([#4795](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4795))

This helps better control the scale when using the image export utilities in tldraw. We now have the option to pass `scale` and `pixelRatio` to the export functions to give more fine-grained control.
