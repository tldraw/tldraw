This release introduces enhancements to grid snapping during shape creation, improves layering mechanics, and provides better control over export functionality.

## What's new

### Grid snapping for shape creation ([#4894](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4894))

Shapes now automatically align to the grid when drawn in grid mode. The new `maybeSnapToGrid` function enables snapping for both click-created and drag-created shapes.

### Improved layering actions ([#4898](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4898))

The "bring forward" and "send backward" actions now only consider nearby overlapping shapes, making layer management more intuitive when working with complex canvases.

## API changes

- Add `scale` and `pixelRatio` parameters to export utilities for more precise control over export dimensions and quality.
- Expose font size and stroke size APIs.
- Add socket close reason for rate limiting.
- Add option to toggle double-click text creation.

## Improvements

- Improve panning performance for note-heavy canvases and zoomed-out views.
- Improve page menu hover interaction.
- Add custom React provider support in SVG exports.
- Switch default theme to light mode.
- Improve frame heading right-click behavior.

## Bug fixes

- Fix off-screen shape zoom-to-edit.
- Fix erasing state stickiness.
- Fix frame heading drag interactions.
- Fix Safari sleep-related crashes.
