This release focuses on bug fixes and performance enhancements, laying groundwork for v3.10 features.

## API changes

- 💥 **`store.createSelectedComputedCache`** removed; use `store.createCache` with custom selector `computed` instead.
- 💥 **`createComputerCache` API** modified: third argument now accepts options object with `areRecordsEqual` and `areResultsEqual` properties instead of single equality function.

## Improvements

- Improve layout operations including align, distribute, flip, and stack with better compatibility for arrows and overlapping shapes.
- Add new `AtomMap` class to accelerate shape, binding, and record creation/deletion, available as a utility for building custom reactive maps.
- Add horizontal padding to text-bound arrows for improved visual appearance.

## Bug fixes

- Fix pasted image size calculations.
- Remove `canvas-size` dependency resolving bundler compatibility issues.
- Fix SVG copy mimetype.
- Fix text shape cloning crash.
- Fix temporary image preview display during uploads.
- Recognize `https://localhost` as development environment for licensing.
