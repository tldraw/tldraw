## Breaking changes

There are no breaking changes in this release.

## User-facing changes

- Improve the 'Select All' action to select within the common parent of the current selection. For example, if you select a shape within a frame, it will select all the shapes within that frame but not the frame itself. ([#6386](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6386))

- Add a user preference option to turn off keyboard shortcuts. ([#6363](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6363))

## API additions

- Add several new `ShapeUtil` callbacks for handle interactions. ([#6489](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/6489))
  - Handle drag start and end callbacks: `onHandleDragStart` and `onHandleDragEnd`.
  - Interaction cancellation callbacks: `onTranslateCancel`, `onResizeCancel`, `onRotateCancel`, and `onHandleDragCancel`.
