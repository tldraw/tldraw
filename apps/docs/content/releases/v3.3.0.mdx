This release introduces sync improvements, readonly mode support, and various performance enhancements.

## What's new

### Readonly mode

Servers can now restrict client editing while preserving presence updates using the new "readonly" mode. This enables use cases like view-only sharing and presentation modes where users can see each other's cursors but cannot modify the document.

### Sync server enhancements

New `TLSocketRoom` methods (`closeSession`, `getRecord`, and `getSessions`) provide finer control over sync connections and room state management.

## API changes

- Add editor option for quick action shortcut placement.
- Add `editor.getIsReadonly()` helper method.

## Improvements

- Pass wheel events through toolbar elements for improved scrolling/zooming.
- Allow Command/Control modifier keys to enable multi-select (previously shift-only).
- Allow text tool to be locked.
- Improve draw shape rendering performance during zoom interactions.

## Bug fixes

- Fix Safari arrow rendering.
- Fix image drop navigation errors.
- Fix watermark layering.
- Fix geometry calculations.
- Fix readonly mode label editing prevention.
