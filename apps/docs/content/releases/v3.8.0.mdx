This update brings a host of improvements across performance, user interface, and developer experience—all while squashing a number of bugs. Read on for a quick summary of the highlights.

### What's New

#### Shape & Asset Enhancements

- **ShapeUtil.configure for shape options** ([#5399](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5399)). Introduces a new utility for passing options to shape utils. (This change also moves note shape resize mode and max draw shape points to their respective configuration objects.)
- **Note Shape Resize Option.** The note shape can be configured to resize by scale. ([#5273](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5273))
- **Asset uploads updated** ([#5218](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5218)). The upload API now returns an object with both the asset `src` and optional metadata—allowing for richer asset records.
- **New "select geo tool" shortcut** ([#5341](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5341)). Quickly select your most recent geometric tool with the `g` shortcut.
- **Drag URLs onto the canvas** ([#5411](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5411)). Drag a URL or link onto the canvas to create a bookmark shape.

#### Developer Experience & API Improvements

- **Exports DX Pass** ([#5114](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5114)). We’ve refined export functionality:
  - The copy/export as JSON option has been removed.
  - Export APIs (like `Editor.getSvgElement` and `Editor.getSvgString`) now handle shape selections more gracefully.
  - Export contexts now expose `scale` and `pixelRatio` options and offer a `resolveAssetUrl` helper.
  - A new `Editor.toImage` method simplifies creating images from your canvas.
- **i18n Enhancements** ([#5208](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5208)). Expanded our localization support to cover the top 40 languages.
- **React 19** ([#5293](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5293)). tldraw now supports React 19.
- **Easier external content customisation** ([#5298](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5298), [#5402](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5402)). You can re-use our default handlers, and now customise pasted tldraw & excalidraw content.
- **Customize input event handling** ([#5319](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5319)). Listen to the `before-event` event to run custom code before tldraw handles input events.
- **Custom cropping** ([#5137](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5137)). There’s a new `onCrop` method that `ShapeUtil`s can implement to opt-into & customize cropping.

### Breaking Changes

- **Shape Options Configuration.** With the introduction of `ShapeUtil.configure`, if you pass in a shape util that shares a type with a default, it now replaces the default instead of crashing. In addition, the previous `options.maxDrawShapePoints` is now set via:
  - `DrawShapeUtil.configure({ maxPoints })`
  - `HighlightShapeUtil.configure({ maxPoints })` ([#5399](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5399), [#5349](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5349))
- **Asset Upload API Changes.** In `@tldraw/tlschema`, `TLAssetStore.upload` now returns an object with `{ src, meta? }` rather than just the source string. Similarly, `Editor.uploadAsset` has been updated to reflect this change. ([#5218](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5218))
- **Export Functionality.** The option to copy/export as JSON has been removed since it was not fully supported. Additionally, hooks like `useImageOrVideoAssetUrl` now require a `width` parameter, and export methods have been updated to export all shapes when no IDs are provided. ([#5114](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5114))
- **Toasts and Dialogs.** The tldraw components now include toasts and dialogs. The `TldrawUiToasts` and `TldrawUiDialogs` components are renamed to `DefaultToasts` and `DefaultDialogs` and can be accessed via `useTldrawUiComponents`.([#5263](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5263)).

### Bug Fixes

- **UI & Interaction Bugs**
  - Resolved dialog and edit menu glitches ([#5274](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5274)).
  - Addressed problems with mousewheel events not working on scrollable elements ([#5356](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5356)).
- **Asset & Export Fixes**
  - Ensured images in exports use the uncropped width ([#5300](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5300)).
  - Corrected paste behavior for text/plain via keyboard shortcuts ([#5303](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5303)).

### Performance & Reliability

- **Improved performance for headings** ([#5413](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5413)). Improved frame performance by relocating computations to their point of use.
