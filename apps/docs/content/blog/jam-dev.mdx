## **Challenge**

Jam’s browser extension only takes one click for developers to send off a bug report and get back to building. However, bug reports are inherently visual, and screenshots alone don’t always tell the full story. Developers need a way to:

- Capture bugs as they happen
- Quickly annotate hover state screenshots with relevant details
- Share them with teammates in a legible and structured way

The problem? **Traditional annotation tools feel clunky, disrupt workflow, and slow down bug reporting.**

Jam needed a solution that made capturing and annotating bugs fast and effortless. That’s where tldraw came in.

## Solution

Jam integrated tldraw’s SDK directly into its browser extension, powering instant, in-product annotations without breaking the workflow.

Using the browser extension, developers simply capture a screenshot of the bug in action, then use Jam’s tldraw integration to:

- Draw directly on screenshots
- Add shapes, arrows, and text for clarity
- Blur sensitive information

Once annotated, Jam bundles the screenshot with all the technical context - console logs, network requests, device info - and generates a shareable link in one click.

> **“It's a library where a lot of good design decisions were made […] tldraw is by far the most extensible in terms of allowing you to leverage what they have already built.”**
> – Rui Conti, Senior Software Engineer @ Jam

## Results

With Jam's tldraw integration, developers can now **capture, annotate, and share bug reports in one seamless flow**. This integration helps enable Jam to cut bug reporting time by 20x, with instant visual context that helps developers understand and fix issues faster.

Complete bug reporting workflow: capture, annotate, and share
