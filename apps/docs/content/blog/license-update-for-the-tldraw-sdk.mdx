</Callout>

Hey, this is [Steve Ruiz](https://twitter.com/steveruizok) from tldraw. This week we launched the first [beta release](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.1) of the [tldraw SDK](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw). This is our first release to include our [new license](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/LICENSE.md), which is adapted from the [Scratch source code license](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Source_Code_License).

This article contains everything there is to know about the new license and what it means for the product. If you‚Äôre a developer who is interested in using the tldraw SDK, this article is for you!

## There‚Äôs a tldraw SDK?

If your intersection with tldraw lore is limited to using [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com) as a whiteboard, you may be surprised to learn that the website is essentially a big demo of our actual product, which is the software library that powers the application‚Äôs canvas.

This [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tldraw/tldraw) is what we mean by the ‚Äútldraw SDK‚Äù.

![Tldraw library](/images/blog/845c2fa1-1fac-4d94-a46c-517fbe8a3361_3020x1974.png 'The tldraw SDK is distributed on NPM under @tldraw/tldraw')

The tldraw SDK is distributed on NPM under @tldraw/tldraw.

Our elevator pitch for the SDK is that people love collaborative canvas apps, however building a canvas from scratch is prohibitively difficult‚Äîunless you build on top of tldraw, in which case it‚Äôs easy.

So far we‚Äôve seen a lot of encouraging adoption: everything from total conversions like [Subset.so](https://subset.so), [Definite](https://definite.app), and [PlaygroundAI](https://playgroundai.com) to whiteboard-and-then-some uses like [Jam.dev](https://jam.dev), [Legend Keeper](https://www.legendkeeper.com/), and [Roam](https://ro.am/).

## The new license

![New tldraw license](/images/blog/0300f92f-267a-45ef-96b5-8759f209a184_2658x944.png)

Under our [new license](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/LICENSE.md), you are permitted to use the tldraw SDK for **non-commercial** purposes. Examples of non-commercial use include using tldraw in a hobby project, a student project, or to contribute bug fixes or changes to the main code-base.

If you would like to use the tldraw SDK in a **commercial product** (or within a commercial enterprise), you will need to purchase a commercial-use license from us by contacting [hello@tldraw.com](mailto:hello@tldraw.com).

## Why dual license?

As a front-end component, tldraw presents unique challenges for commercialization compared to, for example, a pay-as-you-go hosted service or commercial software-as-a-service app.

That said, there are many ways to commercialize a project like tldraw. We‚Äôve discussed selling a hosted collaboration service, similar to [TipTap Collab](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/cloud), or splitting the library into free features and premium features like [AgGrid](https://www.ag-grid.com/), pricing based on usage like [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing), or even turning [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com/) into a teams-based SaaS app like [Excalidraw+](https://plus.excalidraw.com/).

In the end, we chose to adopt a dual licensing model because **we want to stay focused on the core product** rather than on secondary products or services or upsells.

While the core product is solid and extremely capable for whiteboard-like products, there‚Äôs still a _ton_ of work to do in order to make it ideal for other common use-cases, such as fixed-size canvases for presentations and annotation, more complex shape relationships for flow charts and visual programming, and better support for AI-powered collaborators.

## Friction and thrash

Our previous versions of the SDK were released under the permissive Apache-2.0 license, though with a heads-up notice that we‚Äôd be changing this license in the future and a contributor license agreement protecting our right to swap licenses. We‚Äôre now in that future and swap we have.

License changes can sometimes be a rough time for an open source project, but my hope is our community will support us as we begin to capture some of the value that tldraw brings to the companies that use it in commercial products.

## Q&A

Have questions? Here are some common ones so far.

#### Does this change effect tldraw.com?

No, this change has no effect on [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com/). The license discussed in this article only applies to the tldraw SDK. You can use the [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com/) app, our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tldraw-org.tldraw-vscode), or any of our experiments like [Make Real](https://makereal.tldraw.com/) as often and wherever you want.

#### How do I buy a commercial license?

To buy a commercial-use license, [contact us](mailto:hello@tldraw.com) and we‚Äôll take it from there.

#### How much does a commercial use license cost?

We‚Äôre still figuring that out. We‚Äôll publish our initial pricing when we launch the 2.0; but in the meantime, please do [contact us](mailto:hello@tldraw.com) for our special ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt figured it out yet‚Äù pricing, which so far has favored our early customers.

#### I‚Äôm using tldraw in a commercial product but we‚Äôre pre-funding / pre-revenue / testing it out. Do I still need a license?

Yes. [Contact us](mailto:hello@tldraw.com) anyway and we‚Äôll work something out.

#### Do I still need a commercial license if I‚Äôm using the tldraw SDK in an internal product at my company?

Yes, internal products at companies is considered commercial use and so you will need to purchase a license.

#### Can I use the tldraw SDK in a classroom / student project?

Yes, you can use the tldraw SDK for teaching and student projects without needing a commercial license. See the [license](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for more info on what is and isn‚Äôt considered commercial use. [Contact us](mailto:hello@tldraw.com) if you‚Äôre really not sure.

#### Does this license change apply to previous versions?

No, this change does not effect any previous versions. The [1.x version of tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-v1) will remain licensed under MIT forever. This version is essentially parked, however if we issue any updates or patches they will preserve that version‚Äôs MIT license. The pre-release 2.x versions released until Apache-2.0 will remain licensed under Apache-2.0.

#### If I‚Äôm already using the tldraw library in a commercial product, can I stay on an earlier Apache-licensed alpha version?

Yes, if you‚Äôre using tldraw in a commercial way you should stay on the alpha version until you purchase a commercial license and upgrade. Please do [contact us](mailto:hello@tldraw.com) though, we like you and would much rather find a way to bring you up to current releases.

#### Is tldraw still open source?

Mostly? You can still [read our source code](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), fork the code, submit PRs, and use the product for free in certain non-commercial circumstances. It‚Äôs not Open Source in the strictest sense of being under a fully permissive license. Open source is a spectrum üåà and this was the best we could do.
