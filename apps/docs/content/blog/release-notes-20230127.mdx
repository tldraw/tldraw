We’ve been busy! Here are all the changes from this week’s release. They’re all live and ready to try out at [beta.tldraw.com](http://beta.tldraw.com).

## What’s New

- New and improved **style panel** design.

- Revamped tool behaviors. You now return to the select tool after creating a shape.
- Added the **Lock Tool** preference, which will keep your selected tool after creating a shape. To enable the lock tool, select it from **Menu > Preferences > Lock Tool**.

- Added inertia to the **Hand** tool. To toss the canvas around, select the Hand Tool and then click and drag the canvas.

## Improvements

- We now take stroke width into account when spacing out arrows from what they’re connected to.

- Improved the visibility of handles on line shapes for mobile devices.
- Added placeholder SVGs in image exports for embed shapes.
- Changed the line tool behavior to avoid accidental dots.
- Improved tooltips and titles for menu items.
- You can now erase shapes within a frame without erasing the frame itself.

## Fixes

- Fixed **exact arrows** ending too early. Hold the alt/option key while connecting an arrow to make it “exact”.

- Fixed a bug that could prevent wheel events from initiating a drag interaction.

- Fixed a rare bug affecting keyboard shortcuts.

- Fixed some rare desync issues in multiplayer.
