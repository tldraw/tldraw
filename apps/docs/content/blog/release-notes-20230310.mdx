Hello! and welcome to this week’s tldraw update. It’s another big one with the return of .tldr files, some new embed types, and plenty more.

> All of the following changes are now live at [beta.tldraw.com](https://beta.tldraw.com).

## What’s new

We now support **.tldr files** for offline storage and backup!

To save a copy of your current project as a .tldr file, select **Menu > File > Save a copy**.

To open a .tldr file, select **Menu > File > Open file**. Opening a file will replace the contents of your current tldraw editor, so be sure to save a backup before loading something new.

> Currently you can only open .tldr files saved from beta.tldraw.com. You cannot open files saved from tldraw.com or tldraw’s VS Code extension. But hang tight—this should change as soon as next week.

We added **tap gestures** for controlling the app's zoom while using the hand tool.

With the **hand tool** selected, you can zoom in with a double tap, zoom out with a triple tap, and if you’re feeling adventurous, you can reset the zoom to 100% with a quadruple tap.

There’s also a new duplicate button menu on desktop!

## Improvements

We now support embedding **Google Calendar** , **Google Slides** and **Observable** links. You can find them listed in the Embed menu.

We improved the appearance of **freehand lines**. They now handle sharp corners better and they should look cleaner at each end.

When you share a project, the page doesn’t refresh anymore. Click the “Share” button to make your project collaborative straight away.
