A lot has happened over the past 5 months.

We raised [another $2M](https://tldraw.dev/blog/announcements/tldraw-raised-another-2m), made [Make Real](https://tldraw.dev/blog/product/make-real-the-story-so-far), and commissioned a [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BtxSxUAsI). During all that time, we’ve been updating tldraw non-stop.

Tons of new features, fixes, tweaks, reworks, and more, have landed on [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com). These are all in place for the upcoming 2.0 release of [our library](https://tldraw.dev/) (stay tuned).

**Let’s get you up to speed.** Here’s everything new in tldraw from the past 5 months.

## Arrows rework

We completely rebuilt how **arrows** work. They look and feel better than ever. We finally figured out all those [edge cases](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1707139579332137084).

Short arrows move smoothly from shape to shape. There’s no more jumping around.

Curved arrows intersect at the right place on your freehand strokes.

Arrows can even point to and from a shape they’re inside of.

## New ink

We completely rebuilt how our **virtual ink** works. We use a brand new approach, separating brush strokes into smaller pieces.

![New virtual ink](/images/blog/fb7c3149-f7e8-4cf7-bbad-9d3d68de4252_960x540.gif)

It looks much better, especially on corners. And it’s better for performance too, with SVG exports now 13% smaller.

## Selection overhaul

We completely rebuilt how **selection** works.

The library now “sees” the geometry of every shape and uses that information to handle all your clicking, dragging, stretching, and scribbling.

![Shape geometry](/images/blog/7e449c5c-a566-4046-a82c-78ad375e80b0_960x540.gif)

We now handle those inputs ourselves in code instead of relying on individual HTML elements for hit-testing. This means that we’ve been able to drastically cut down on the number of elements on screen, many of which existed only for the hit-testing. Everything runs quicker.

![Input handling](/images/blog/6c741f27-5139-432a-b01b-e6a7cfd30f92_960x540.gif)

This new approach also gives us more control over how selection works. We can now make better decisions about you hit when you click, especially when working with “unfilled” shapes.

![Click selection](/images/blog/ccb21a14-a59b-4208-bca5-66fe8e540a91_960x540.gif)

The new hit testing is even better with arrows, with much smarter decision-tree for identifying pointed-to shapes.

## The cloud

We added a **cloud shape**! It’s so fluffy. And it looks good at any size.

## Powered up frames

_We_ _completely rebuilt…_ how **frames** work. You can now frame your shapes by drawing around them with the frame tool.

![Rebuilt frames](/images/blog/b7963670-ed11-4164-94f8-00ad9c50f64f_960x540.gif)

You can remove a frame without deleting its contents. Just right-click (or long press), then click the **Remove frame** button.

![Remove frame](/images/blog/1a76d995-eb41-44dc-99c3-738d67609c61_960x540.gif)

You can now crop a frame from the top-left by holding command (or control).

![Crop frame](/images/blog/ac319347-5f2e-4715-a655-29497276eb5b_960x540.gif)

Soon, you’ll be able to auto-size frames too.

## Multi-laser

We improved how the **laser pointer** works. You can now draw multiple laser trails at the same time.

This change also comes to the eraser and selection tools.

## Revamped locked shapes

**Locked shapes** now behave better. They don’t show a hover indicator. You can right-click them more easily. And you can select multiple things on top of them.

![Locked shapes](/images/blog/5f3dc9f0-bfaa-4915-b0ab-14ed082ba6f9_960x540.gif)

We’ve also added an **Unlock all** button. It unlocks all locked shapes on your current page. No more right clicking everything.

## Docs makeover

We made a **new docs site**. Go check it out at [tldraw.dev](https://tldraw.dev/).

## More improvements

There’s more! We tightened up our **user interface**, and fine-tuned some colors.

![Updated UI](/images/blog/ac4e3a05-8e40-4fbf-ac12-16e3e7093219_960x540.gif)

We added an **offline indicator** to let you know when your connection drops.

We tuned the timings for **cursor chat**. Your chat bubble now stays around for a short while, and automatically disappears at a suitable time.

We simplified how **text editing** works. Clicking from one text shape to another now selects the whole shape. It doesn’t throw you straight into typing.

When you export a drawing, we now **timestamp** the file for you. Say goodbye to `“shapes(1)(1)(1).png”`

We updated our **translations** for Spanish, Japanese, German, Galician, Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese. More translations are coming soon. Thank you for your [contributions](https://tldraw.dev/community/translations)!

We finally added a **404 page**. Still no landing page or login though. Just go to [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com/) and start drawing.
