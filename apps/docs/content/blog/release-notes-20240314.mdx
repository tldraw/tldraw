Hey! Welcome back to another tldraw release.

If you [didn’t notice](https://twitter.com/tldraw/status/1763272673444913432), we pushed out version 2.0 of the [tldraw SDK](https://tldraw.dev/). We’ll have more info on that _another day_. But for now, let’s look all the new features and fixes that it brings to [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com).

## What’s new

Shared projects now have a **title** at the the top of the page. Edit the title by double clicking it.

We added a new **Export** menu for exporting the entire page — not just your current selection.

With this release, we also completely rebuilt how **snapping** works for lines. Lines can now snap to the corners and centers of shapes.

And now the **middle handles** of lines can snap too.

Lines can also snap to themselves.

> By the way, you can enable snapping by holding command/control while dragging, or turning on **Always snap** in the Preferences menu.

## Improvements

You now get some visual feedback when you copy shapes on top of themselves. Your selection box **blinks** to let you know that the paste worked.

You now default to the **Hand tool** in read-only mode, making it easier to pan around straight away.

And we shortened the **invite links** for shared projects.
