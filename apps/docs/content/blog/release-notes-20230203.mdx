There’s been lots of [behind-the-scenes](https://twitter.com/tldraw/status/1617931796968263680) work this week! At the same time, we’re getting in more features and fixes too.

Here are all the changes from this week. You can try them out at [beta.tldraw.com](https://beta.tldraw.com).

## What’s New

- You can now choose the **Draw** tool by pressing the `[b]` or `[x]` key. Pressing `[d]` still works too!
- We reduced the size of the **tool panel** by moving some shapes into a sub-menu.
