## Challenge

[ClickUp](https://clickup.com) is an all-in-one productivity tool used by over ten million users across startups and enterprise. Visual collaboration has always been a key part of that vision, so when their original Whiteboards product launched in 2021, it was positioned as a flagship feature.

As the Whiteboards product grew, the ClickUp team scaled its feature set significantly, building on its tools and integrations. However, they often found themselves limited by early architectural decisions restricting what they could achieve. They wanted to be in a position to add new functionality without friction, and they knew they could do even better on polish and UX.

To meet these aspirations, the team faced a decision: continue improving the existing system, or rebuild with a more flexible architecture to support their growing needs. ClickUp explored building from scratch and considered several alternatives, but in the end, they decided to use the tldraw SDK.

## Solution

Out of the box, the tldraw SDK brought ClickUp all of the small but important quality of life features they were looking for. Hotkeys, context menus and frames were new to the Whiteboards product, and the team got them on day one. They also immediately eliminated many of their legacy interaction bugs by switching over.

The SDK provided a flexible foundation for ClickUp to build out the features they wanted. Live views of docs and tasks from the rest of the platform can be placed directly onto the board thanks to custom shapes built by the team. They also took steps to completely change tldraw’s look and feel to match the rest of the ClickUp application. This included adding a custom floating toolbar above the user’s selection and an animated UI that reacts to the user’s current state. This was all possible through the SDK’s customization APIs.

Some of ClickUp’s customizations involved maintaining consistency from the previous version of Whiteboards. The floating toolbar, for instance, was something they wanted to bring forward. They also experimented and innovated with newer features, including AI generation, and the team is currently working on a feature that can turn your whiteboard content into a fully fledged project using ClickUp AI.

## Result

Whiteboards are one of our most loved features in ClickUp. tldraw’s technology enabled us to deliver a high-quality foundation and also develop native functionality ourselves. The technology and team have been great to work with.\

Since the relaunch of Whiteboards in December 2024, its popularity among users has dramatically increased. At the same time, the ClickUp team has been able to develop and explore further product features with speed, focusing more on what their users want and less on canvas interaction issues.
