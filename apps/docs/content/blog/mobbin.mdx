## Challenge

[Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/) helps designers and product teams streamline research and find inspiration for their work by providing a comprehensive library of UI and UX designs from real-world digital products.

Behind the scenes, teams at Mobbin relied on a traditional content management system to power the product’s content curation and machine learning workflows. However, as Mobbin grew more complex and more unique in its content structure, their CMS couldn’t keep up.

After spending months hunting for an alternative solution that could fit their requirements, the team finally decided that the best way forward was to create something new.

## Solution

Building custom software solution is no small task, especially one that leverages a canvas. To make the project realistic, Mobbin needed an engine—and they found a perfect fit in tldraw’s infinite canvas SDK. The SDK offered a fast, flexible, and developer-friendly foundation to build exactly what they needed without compromise.

“Because tldraw is so powerful, we can update the logic to fit our needs exactly.”

With a small team of three—Jian Jie Liau, CTO & Co-Founder of Mobbin, and two company engineers—the company designed, built, and shipped two fully functional internal tools in just three months:

- A **high-precision machine learning research tool** allowing the ML team to annotate UI elements, benchmark models, and refine data for training more effectively.
- A **content curation workflow** that lets the Content Team organize, tag, and manage thousands of design references at scale.

Mobbin’s custom tool for content curation

The team was able to move quickly by leveraging tldraw SDK’s included tools and features, such as its camera and selection logic, as well as building on its APIs for custom shapes and element types. And since Mobbin and tldraw both use the React framework, the team was able to use its existing skills to build their integration.

“If we had tried to build our own tool from scratch, we couldn’t have done it any faster—or made the process any smoother.”

## Results

The content you see on Mobbin today is curated using a custom canvas tool built on tldraw. With their bespoke solution, Mobbin’s Content Team ensures that every design showcased is relevant and high-quality.

“We chose tldraw because we can really see ourselves continuing to build in the long term with it. It’s very extensible.”

Their development process is accelerating, too. There’s no need to wait for feature requests—the team builds exactly what they need, when they need it, while still benefiting each month from the performance improvements, fixes, and features coming downstream from the tldraw SDK.
