Welcome to the June 20th update for tldraw. Over the past few weeks, we’ve quietly rolled out a number of new features, improvements and fixes. Try them out now on [tldraw.com][10], or read on for the full details.

## What’s new

We added a new **dynamic size** mode that adjusts the scale of your shapes to match your current zoom level. When this mode is enabled, you can create smaller-scale shapes by zooming in, or bigger scale shapes by zooming out.

> You can try out the new mode at **Menu > Preferences > Dynamic Size**.

Big news for lovers: we added a **heart shape**.

You can now **flatten** multiple shapes together. This is especially useful for grouping your handwriting together. To flatten shapes, right-click a selection and press Flatten.

You can now create a **new shared project** without overwriting your existing one, using a new button at **Menu > File > New shared project**.

## One neat trick

_This update includes a brand new easter egg._

You can now give your shapes a **completely** **solid fill** by pressing Option/Alt + F. Finally you can draw what you want!

## Improvements

We've added a **level of detail** system for images. On shared tldraw rooms, we now optimize images by loading smaller versions of the model when resized or zoomed out. If you have many high-resolution images on your canvas, you'll notice a significant performance boost.

We now support up to **4,000 shapes** on a page at a time, up from the previous limit of 2000 shapes per shape.

**Edge scrolling** is improved with a short delay (to avoid accidental edge scrolls) and a delightful curve gradual acceleration in speed.

You can now select **system theme** from **Menu > Preferences > Color scheme** to automatically set your dark mode.

**Zoom to fit** is now a bit tighter than it used to be. You can use Shift + 1 or select it from the zoom menu.

We’ve improved the **undo/redo behaviour when cropping** an image. Now, when you’ve finished cropping an image, undo will return the image to its un-cropped state in one step, without needing to undo each individual change.

The **share menu** will now open automatically after navigating to [tldraw.com/new](https://tldraw.com/new), making it easier to share your multiplayer room with others.
