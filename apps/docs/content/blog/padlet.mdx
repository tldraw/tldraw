## Challenge

Padlet is a digital platform that enables users to create, organize, and share content in a collaborative space. Somewhere between a simple document and a full-fledged website, Padlet allows individuals and teams to build interactive boards, portfolios, and presentations with ease.

In September 2023, Padlet—a company with over 40 million monthly active users—faced an unexpected challenge. Google announced it was phasing out Jamboard, the whiteboarding tool Padlet relied on for their EdTech platform.

Padlet needed a replacement that supported education-specific safety requirements, real-time collaboration, and cross-time compatibility—and they needed it fast.

By mid-April 2024, after considering various options, including building their own whiteboard from scratch, Padlet realized they didn’t have time to reinvent the wheel, and that doing so would mean sacrificing features—such as content moderation—that were important for their launch.

What they needed to find was a powerful, extensible foundation to deliver a whiteboarding solution their users could rely on.

## Solution

By the end of April 2024, the Padlet team landed on tldraw’s SDK “because it’s lightweight, fast, and packed with tools right from the start”—and immediately got to work.

Within just two and a half months of starting full-scale development, Padlet successfully launched Padlet Sandbox at The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Conference in June 2024.

Padlet Sandbox is a collaborative digital canvas for drawing, writing, and media integration, designed for interactive documents, presentations, and activities. The numbers speak for themselves:

- 436,000 monthly visitors
- 140,000 new Sandboxes created every month
- ~10% of all new Padlets are now Sandboxes

Padlet Sandbox offers a structured yet flexible whiteboarding experience tailored for education, built on tldraw’s core technology. Some features include Play Mode for distraction-free presentation; classroom-specific sharing & permissions capabilities; as well as dashboards and templates.

Student safety was non-negotiable. With robust content moderation tools, Padlet Sandbox ensures a secure learning environment with admin controls, safety net customizations, and automatic filters.

“Content moderation was one of the more important features since we want Sandbox to be safe for use for children in classrooms. With the help of tldraw's team from the Discord channel, we managed to navigate and extend the SDK to support our use case.”

## Results

Padlet’s decision to leverage tldraw saved months of development time while allowing them to deliver a feature-rich, safe, and scalable whiteboarding solution.

“I can say that we've saved a lot of engineering time by using tldraw, and with tldraw’s technical support, it’s easier to develop the project in the way that we want and provide teachers and students with the tool that they need.”

If Padlet had built Sandbox from scratch, they would have had to sacrifice key features—including the vital content moderation tools that ensure a safe environment for students.

From the initial crisis of losing Google Jamboard to a seamless launch in record time, tldraw helped Padlet go from idea to execution with speed, flexibility, and quality.

Padlet Sandbox is now a cornerstone of Padlet’s offerings, proving that the right technology partnership can make all the difference.
