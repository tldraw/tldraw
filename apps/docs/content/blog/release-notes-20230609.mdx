Hello! And welcome to this week’s release for [tldraw](https://tldraw.com). Today, we’re launching two of our most-requested features: a **highlighter shape** and support for **locked shapes**.

## What’s new

### **Highlighter**

It’s here! You can select the **highlighter** from the tools menu, or by pressing Shift + D.

Enjoy the new colors as well as the [sandwich mode](https://twitter.com/SomeHats/status/1656605608844435456) rendering of the highlighter style.

### **Locking**

You can now **lock shapes**! To lock a shape, open the context menu and select **Toggle locked**.

You can’t move or select locked shapes. It’s useful for when you have shapes in the background that you don’t want to select.

And speaking of locking, there’s also

## A neat trick

you can use to **lock your tool**.

Normally, you return to the select tool after making a shape. But turn on **tool lock** , and you’ll stay in your tool — letting you continue making shapes.

You can toggle this behavior in the toolbar or the preferences menu.

## Improvements

You can now **drag** more things onto the tldraw canvas than ever before! Drag an image from another website—or drag a link to make a bookmark or embed shape.

You can also now choose the vertical alignment of your text in **sticky notes**.

We also added a **reduce motion** option to preferences. When enabled, our camera won’t animate when you zoom in or out or use the minimap.

We’ve also moved the actions bar to the bottom on medium-sized screens to make up more space at the top. Why would we need more space at the top of the screen? Tune in next week to find out.

## Fixes

- Fixed a rare crash that could happen when you try to curve an arrow with zero distance.
- Fixed nudging with the shift-key held down.
- Fixed a bug where exports would sometimes fail when they were too big for your browser. Now, they're scaled down to the max supported size.
- Separately, we reduced the file size of exported files in general.
- Fixed being able to undo viewport-following.
- Mac: Fixed control-clicking not opening the context menu.
- Safari: Fixed a bug where you couldn’t copy snapshot links.
