We’ve got notes on this week’s release. Would you like to read them?

Everything mentioned here will land in [our SDK]() next week but you can try them out right now on [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com/). Let’s look at what’s new, what’s changed, and what’s fixed.

## What’s new

We added a **new label** alignment option to the style panel, so you can now control the alignment of text and shape labels separately.

You can have your text aligned one way, and your labels aligned a different way. And **text is now left-aligned by default**!

Our **minimap is now much faster** and more reliable, even on tablets and phones.

**We’ve added support for Desmos embeds** in the editor. Paste your graph’s URL and we’ll create an interactive shape on the canvas. Thanks to GitHub user "not-first" for the contribution.

You can now **embed tldraw inside of iframes**. Paste a multiplayer tldraw link into an app like Notion and you’ll again have the chance to interact with the canvas.

## One neat trick

_Here’s **one neat trick** (segment back by popular demand)._

In tldraw, you can create two different types of text.

1. Pick the text tool and **click** to create some automatically sized text. It will grow as you type more into it.
2. Or **click and drag** to create some text with a fixed size. It wraps your writing over multiple lines.

To change fixed sized text back to automatic, double-click on the left or right-hand edge.

## Improvements

When you’re zoomed out a long way, we now only show **one** handle on note shapes. This makes it easier to grab them without accidentally pulling on a handle.

Did you know you can use tldraw with pressure-sensitive devices like iPad pencils and Wacom tablets? We now **more accurately detect devices with pressure** and assign the right digital ink options, even if your device isn’t technically a pen.

Speaking of ink, we’ve followed up on last release’s performance improvements with another set of **improvements to freehand lines**.

We’ve also updated our translations. French and Korean saw some big updates, and tldraw now supports Indonesian! Thank you to Muhajayaanwar, Benchekroun Mohamed Badr, Cyberuls, and Sabri Eddir for the contributions.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug where tldraw could [infinitely nest](https://twitter.com/TodePond/status/1785258740565848340) inside itself.
- Embed shapes can now link back to their own site.
- Fixed error sound when copying on Safari.
- Fixed alignment of board title.
- Fixed sticky notes aligning incorrectly.
- Fixed paste not working from the Edit menu on Safari.
- And fixed text resizing while holding the alt key.
