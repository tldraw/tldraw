Good news! After four months in public beta, the new version of tldraw is almost ready to leave beta and take its place at [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com/).

Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about the switchover.

üìÜ On **Tuesday April 4th 2023** at 9:30UTC we will be taking both [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com/) and [beta.tldraw.com](http://beta.tldraw.com/) offline. If you're using either app at that time, you'll get a notice that the app is down for maintenance. If all goes well, we should be back up in an hour or two.

Once our migration is complete, there will be some differences.

### **URLs**

All [beta.tldraw.com](http://beta.tldraw.com/) URLs will re-direct to [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com/) URLs.

### **Local content**

If you were working on a local project at [beta.tldraw.com](http://beta.tldraw.com/), we‚Äôll move the contents of that project over to [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com/). We'll do some fancy tricks in your browser to move the data between hosts, however that data will never be sent to our servers.

### **Shared projects**

All shared projects from the original version of tldraw will still work but they will be migrated to the new version. All shared projects (aka multiplayer rooms) from [beta.tldraw.com](http://beta.tldraw.com/) will be available at the same URL on [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com/).

In the rare case that there are two rooms with the same room ids, then the content from beta.tldraw.com‚Äôs room id will be prefixed with ‚Äúv2\_‚Äù.

For example, because both **tldraw.com/r/ok** and **beta.tldraw.com/r/ok** have the same room id (‚Äúok‚Äù), we‚Äôll put the content from beta.tldraw.com/r/ok at beta.tldraw.com/r/v2_ok.

### **Missing features**

There are a handful of features from the original version that have not made it into the new version, such as locked shapes. We‚Äôll be moving that data over to the new version, even if we aren‚Äôt using it yet.

### [old.tldraw.com](http://old.tldraw.com/)

We will be hosting the original version of tldraw at [old.tldraw.com](http://old.tldraw.com/). This version will not support multiplayer, though you will be able to view read-only versions of multiplayer projects from the old version. You will also be able to load .tldr files in this version. While we won‚Äôt be making any updates to this version, we will host it until the end of time (or the end of tldraw, whichever comes first).

### .**tldr files**

The new version of tldraw is already able to load and migrate .tldr files created in the original version of tldraw. However, should you need to open the file in the original version, you can use old.tldraw.com

### **Visual Studio Code extension**

We will be shipping a new version of our Visual Studio Code extension that uses the editor from the new version. After the launch, update your extension from within Visual Studio Code to upgrade.

### Open source

The original version of tldraw will remain available on Github and MIT licensed, though it will be moved to a new repository when we open source the new version. We will no longer be actively maintaining the original but will be happy to support a community fork under a different name.
