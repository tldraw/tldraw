Hello! And welcome to our weekly tldraw release. We skipped last week so enjoy the double batch of product updates.

## What’s new

We added **zoom gestures**. You can now zoom in by holding the `[z]` key and either clicking or dragging a box around whatever you’d like to zoom toward, or zoom out by doing the same thing while holding `[option]` or `[alt]` key.

We changed how **exporting a frame** works. If you export a single frame, the exported image won’t have extra padding like usual. And we use the frame's name for the file name.

We also added an **Insert embed** button to the menu. You could always reach it from the tool menu but now it’s easier to find.

## Improvements

We improved how geometric shapes look with the **freehand style**.

Arrows that are bound to a shape now look more correct when you duplicate them without the shapes that they were bound to. A _subtle_ improvement for fellow arrow connoisseurs brought to you by the team at tldraw.

Speaking of arrows, bound arrows now **flip correctly** by also flipping the point where they’re bound to in order to preserve the overall layout. A _nuanced_ improvement for fellow arrowbois brought to you by the team at tldraw.

We now hide the little **quick actions menu** when you’re using the hand tool. On mobile, we also now show handles on the sides of the text shape to indicate that you can edit their width.

We increased the size of crop handles on mobile, to make it easier to use with touch controls, and we improved the performance of the app when panning and zooming.
