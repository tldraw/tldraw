Welcome back to another tldraw release.

Here’s everything we added this week. Try them out on [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com/), or learn how to add tldraw to your own app by visiting [our docs site]().

## What’s new

You can now **move arrow labels** to any position along the arrow.

You can now select tools from the toolbar by pressing the **number keys**. Select the first tool by pressing 1. Select the second tool by pressing 2. And so on.

It’s like minecraft.

## Improvements

Previously, the **Duplicate** button always made new shapes appear to the right.

With this update, you can duplicate repeatedly in **any chosen direction**.

To do this, drag to a chosen position while holding the option key (or alt key), then press the **Duplicate** button. It will mimic the direction and distance that you chose.

Shapes can now snap to the insides of frames.

And our menus look more beautiful!
