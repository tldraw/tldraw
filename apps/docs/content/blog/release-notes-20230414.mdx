Hello! And welcome back to another tldraw release.

Last week we left beta and upgraded [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com) to our new version. If you’re feeling nostalgic then you can still find the original tldraw is still up at [old.tldraw.com](https://old.tldraw.com), and read more about the change in our [blog post](https://tldraw.dev/blog/product/tldraws-upcoming-re-launch).

We’ve also released our new Visual Studio Code extension. You can use the extension to work with offline **.tldr** files in your VS Code editor. Learn more and install the extension [on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tldraw-org.tldraw-vscode).

But now it’s time for some more changes! Read on what’s landed this last week.

## What’s new

You can now **crop images and GIFs**. Double-click or press the enter key to start cropping.

You can drag the cropped image around.

Double-click an edge to reset the crop.

> Tired of double clicking? You can also crop an image by dragging an edge while holding the command or control key.

We also added a **New project** button to the menu. Use it to clear the current project and start over.

## Improvements

We improved **cursor responsiveness** on the whole. You can now draw, select and interact while your camera moves around.

Collaborator cursors now look and feel more responsive too. No more [wobbling](https://twitter.com/tldraw/status/1643652330850484238) or stuttering.

And thanks to our community contributors, we’ve added and updated translations for Catalan, Finnish, Galician, Korean, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Traditional Chinese.

## Fixes

- Added titles to overflow buttons in the UI.
- Tightened up the corner radius of frames in image exports.
- Fixed keyboard nudging happening when you’re in the middle of another action.
- Fixed a bug with pasting large SVGs that could cause your shared project to get out of sync.
- Fixed a bug where visiting a read-only project would lock a user into read-only mode even on the regular project URL.
- Replaced justify text alignment with a placeholder for a future ‘position’ setting.
- Fixed a bug where a hole could appear in short solid lines.
- Fixed a bug where the camera could get stuck after using the minimap.
- Fixed a bug where arrows sometimes didn’t connect correctly when importing projects from the original tldraw.
- When importing projects from the original tldraw, you now start in the first page instead of the last.
- Firefox: Fixed a bug where your cursor could get stuck after using the control key.
