Hello! and welcome back to another tldraw release.

[Last time around](https://tldraw.dev/blog/release-notes/release-notes-june-9th-2023) we shipped a bunch of new stuff. This month we’ve been working on the developer side of tldraw: a wrapped up version of tldraw that developers can put inside of their own apps and extend to make their own [weird stuff](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1674376276788883456). If that sounds interesting to you, learn more at [tldraw.dev](https://www.tldraw.dev).

We have however still managed to sneak in some new features, fixes and plenty of improvements for [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com). Let’s go through what’s new!

## What’s new

You can now use **cursor chat** in shared projects.

Start chatting by pressing the forward slash key **/** in a shared project. Type your message and it will be visible to other people in the project before disappearing after a few seconds.

Remember: you can change your name, cursor color, and follow or unfollow other users from the people menu up top. Your choices here will follow you from project to project, too!

## Improvements

We improved how we store tldraw multiplayer rooms. Less downtime, faster loads!

Our multiplayer servers now deal with larger document sizes. Previously, sharing a project was limited based on the size of the project. We’ve increased that limit so that you can share much larger projects.

Our loading and error screens now support dark mode.

We added more community contributed translations for Farsi, Italian, Russian, Simplified Chinese and Ukrainian.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug where touching the screen too many times could exit pen mode.
- We now cull off-screen shapes correctly, to make panning and zooming smoother.
- Fixed a crash when trying to rotate a deleted shape.
- Fixed a bug where shape-snapping could crash the app.
- Fixed groups exporting incorrectly in images.
- Fixed a problem where assets were not loading in snapshots.
- Fixed some rare inconsistency issues with multiplayer rooms.
- Fixes some state management bugs that manifested in multiplayer rooms.
