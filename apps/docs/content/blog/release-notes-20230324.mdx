Hello! and welcome to this week’s release notes for tldraw.

Earlier this week, we sent out a note about our upcoming migration as our [new version](https://beta.tldraw.com) leaves beta and takes its proper place at tldraw.com. (We’ve already got a home prepared for the original version at [old.tldraw.com](https://old.tldraw.com)).

We’ve also kicked off an **alpha for the new version’s developer release**. You can read more about it at [docs.tldraw.dev](https://docs.tldraw.dev) or check out [this sandbox](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-ahoswhus?file=src%2FApp.tsx) (generated by our [examples repo](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-examples)).

## What’s new

We splashed out for **translations**!

You can now find **full** translations in the app for:

- Simplified Chinese
- French
- German
- Spanish
- Hindi
- Arabic

We’ve also brought over many translated words from the original version of tldraw, all of which were contributed by members of the community. This brings our list of _partially_ supported languages to:

- Danish
- Farsi
- Galician
- Hebrew
- Hindi
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Kurdish
- Malaysian
- Nepali
- Norwegian
- Portugese
- Brazilian Portugese
- Russian
- Swedish
- Telugu
- Thai
- Turkish
- Ukrainian

That’s about **3,000 translations** total. According to the project’s long-time sponsor [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/), that’s only about 34% of the total. If you speak a second language and are interested in contributing translations, [drop by the discord](https://discord.tldraw.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=release-notes) and let us know.

## Improvements

We’ve greatly increased performance on multiplayer projects. We found a **kink in the data hose** that could sometimes occur when multiple people were creating shapes at the same time. We’ve **unkinked the data hose**.

When you create a new page, it now **scrolls into view** in the page menu.

We’ve **stopped preloading** certain image assets , which should increase loading speed when starting up the app for the first time.

Images, videos, and embeds are now always created with **full opacity**.

We added a **confirmation dialog** when opening a file from the [original tldraw](https://old.tldraw.com/). And in case you missed it from last week, the beta can now open files that were created with the original tldraw!
