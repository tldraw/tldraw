Hey, happy new year!

The source code for [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com) is now available in our [public repo](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw). And we’ve been filling it with plenty of new features and fixes. **Here they are.**

## What’s new

**Arrow scooting**. You can now move your arrows around without disconnecting them.

**Edge scrolling**. Drag your shapes to the edge of the screen to nudge the camera along.

You can also **edge scroll** while selecting, resizing, framing, and more.

## Improvements

We have a **looser font** now. We made it more wobbly so that it matches our freehand ink better.

We have a **new dark mode** theme too. We made the background darker. And we gave the colors some more pop.

Also, image uploads are now faster thanks to some sneaky optimisations.

And we added [community translations](https://tldraw.dev/community/translations/) for Czech and Hungarian. We also updated our translations for German, Korean, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Chinese.
