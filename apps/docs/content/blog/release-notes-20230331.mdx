Hello! and welcome to this week‚Äôs release notes for [tldraw](https://beta.tldraw.com).

This will be the final update before we exit beta, so expect some last-minute house-cleaning and quality assurance while we prepare for our (re)launch. üöÄ If you‚Äôd like to learn more about that, check out our [blog post](https://tldraw.dev/blog/product/tldraws-upcoming-re-launch/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=release-notes)!

## What‚Äôs new

You can now paste from **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)**. While the styles are a bit different between the two apps, we‚Äôve done our best to preserve your choices (such as labels and arrow bindings).

You can now **move content to a new page** with the context menu. Previously, you would have had to create that new page first. To try it out, right click on a shape or selection and select **Move to page > new page**.

We‚Äôve restored the ability to **snap to the center** of a shape by dragging a handle close to the center. Yet another surprisingly nuanced arrow feature.

There‚Äôs been a huge community effort around **translations**! Thanks to our amazing contributors, you can now find **full translations** for 10 additional languages:

- Catalan (new)
- Finnish (new)
- Italian
- Korean
- Nepali
- Romanian (new)
- Russian
- Thai
- Ukrainian
- Vietnamese (new)

There‚Äôs also improved **partial** support for 6 languages:

- Arabic

- Galician
- Hungarian (new)

- Turkish

And we‚Äôve **updated** some of our existing languages too, based on community contributions:

- German
