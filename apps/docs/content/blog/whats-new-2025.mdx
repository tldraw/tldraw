Hey, it’s been a while since we last spoke in June, and a lot has happened.

We’ve been busy launching accounts on [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=whats-new-25), shipping new developer tools like [tldraw sync](https://tldraw.dev/blog/product/announcing-tldraw-sync), and building an [AI powered computer](https://computer.tldraw.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=whats-new-25). And today, we’re excited to finally release one of our most requested features: Rich text is finally here.

Let’s get you up to speed on everything that’s landed since we last saw the sun. As always, you can try out all of these changes on [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=whats-new-25). Let us know what you think by joining the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.tldraw.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=whats-new-25).

## Logged in tldraw

For the first time, you can now **log in** to save and keep track of your boards on [tldraw.com](http://tldraw.com).

You can see your recent boards in the sidebar, all safely stored in the cloud and synced between devices. Pin your faves to the top. Rename, delete, download, and share all from one place.

Of course, if you love the frictionless experience of tldraw, **you can still use the app without logging in.** Your work will continue saving locally in your browser.

If you _do_ sign up, you now have greater control over how you share your files. You can invite others as editors or viewers, or keep your board private, and even change this retroactively for the first time.

To share a project, just send the link. Anyone with the link will be able to join and work with you immediately, even without logging in (unless you change your mind and switch to private).

You can now also **publish** your board to deploy a read-only snapshot of your work. If you want to update your published board, hit the **Publish changes** button.

We have a perfect new export menu, too.

## Rich text

Our much-awaited **rich text** feature is now live.

You can now style separate parts of text, whether it’s on the canvas or inside a shape label. Embolden, italicize and highlight for emphasis. Use inline code formatting for technical work, and create bullet lists for organization.

You can even add [links](https://tldraw.dev/jobs) directly within text and labels.

The floating rich text toolbar stays **perfectly positioned** as you move, resize, or change your view, keeping the new options easily accessible at all times.

We’ll have more to say about rich text soon, and we expect it to reach [our SDK](https://tldraw.dev/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=whats-new-25) next week.

# Improvements

We brought many more improvements to the app. Here are some highlights.

### New shortcuts

You can now move around your board without taking your hands off the keyboard. To move the camera, hold down the Spacebar and use the Arrow keys.

You can now select multiple shapes by holding down the Command or Control modifier keys and clicking on your shapes one after the other. Previously, only Shift allowed you to do this.

To quickly switch to your last used geometric tool, press the G key.

### Images

Mirror, mirror, on the canvas: You can now flip images horizontally and vertically.

### Better text

You can now lock the text tool. When you want to go on a writing spree, switch to the text tool, then click the lock icon just above the Toolbar. This lets you repeatedly add text to the canvas without interruptions.

And we got rid of a tiny paper cut: We now prevent the accidental creation of tiny text shapes.

### Draggable bookmarks

You can now create a Bookmark shape by dragging a URL onto the canvas. Previously, you could only do this by pasting your link.

### Paste at point

In Preferences, you can now choose whether pasted content appears under your cursor, or at the center of your screen.

### Dynamic arrow labels

We fixed arrow labels so that they dynamically rewrap text when you drag them around. Your text now automatically fits the arrow’s shape.

### Smart arrangement

We rehauled how our arrangement buttons work. In doing this, we improved and fixed behaviors for: Aligning, flipping, distributing, stretching, packing and stacking selections, including those with arrows and mismatched shape sizes.

[GIF: before and after, see https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/5479]

We also made the **Bring forward** and **Send backward** actions more helpful by ensuring they only consider the order of _nearby_ shapes when reordering.

### Snap to grid

Newly created shapes now snap to the grid when Grid mode is enabled. This means everything can be automatically lined up for you, whether you’re moving or creating shapes.

### New translations

We expanded our localization support to cover the top 40 most commonly spoken languages.

Pssst: If you’d like to help with translating or reviewing translations, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.tldraw.com/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=sociallink) so that we can add you to the project.

### A tiny little detail

We changed the **X-box** icon to look more representative of the shape itself. It all adds up.

That’s all for now, but we have lots more in the works…

As always, let us know what you think of these changes. We read every message on our [Discord](https://discord.tldraw.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=whats-new-25), and we’re “surprisingly responsive” according to many of you, so please do join us there.

Of course, we love seeing what you build with our SDK, so [try it out](https://tldraw.dev/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=whats-new-25) and show us what you do.

Until next time, happy drawing.
