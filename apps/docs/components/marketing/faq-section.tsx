				Our license is not exactly <BlueA href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source</BlueA> but

				<BlueA href="https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw">GitHub</BlueA>. We accept contributions from

		q: 'How can I get help and support with the SDK?',

				The best place for community support is either{' '}
				<BlueA href="https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw">GitHub</BlueA> or{' '}
				<BlueA href="https://discord.com/invite/SBBEVCA4PG">Discord</BlueA>.
			</>

		q: 'Where can I find examples of apps built with the tldraw SDK?',
		a: (
			<>
				We have a <BlueA href="https://github.com/tldraw/awesome-tldraw">awesome-tldraw</BlueA> repo
				where we collect links to awesome projects built with tldraw. You can also check out the
				#show-and-tell channel on our{' '}
				<BlueA href="https://discord.com/invite/SBBEVCA4PG">Discord</BlueA> community.

		q: 'How do I request a feature for tldraw?',

				You can request features through our{' '}

				<BlueA href="https://discord.com/invite/SBBEVCA4PG">Discord</BlueA>.
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		q: 'Can I use tldraw in a commercial application?',
		a: (
			<>
				Yes. From tldraw 3.0 onward, you can use the SDK for free in commercial or non-commercial
				contexts so long as the watermark is present. If you want to remove the watermark, you can
				purchase a license from us.
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		q: 'How do I get rid of the watermark?',
		a: (
			<>
				You can remove the watermark by <BlueA href="#pricing">purchasing a license</BlueA> from us.
				We will send you a{' '}
				<BlueA
					href="https://tldraw.notion.site/License-keys-in-tldraw-e5e8566857f64a709ef23ab30336e66c
"
				>
					license key
				</BlueA>{' '}
				that you can use to remove the watermark. If you want to use the SDK for free, you have to
				keep the watermark as it is. Read our standard default license for more information.
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		q: 'Does the SDK collect diagnostics?',
		a: (
			<>
				The only information we collect relates to requests for our static assets (such as our
				default fonts, icons and watermark). If you{' '}
				<BlueA href="/installation#Static-Assets">self-host</BlueA> all static assets and have a
				license to remove the watermark then all no external requests are made.
			</>
		),
	},
	{
		q: 'Can I use tldraw in frameworks other than React?',
		a: (
			<>
				Yes, though your app will have to embed React for the component. The SDK uses React for
				rendering only, and most of the tldraw SDK is regular TypeScript; so we may add first-class
				support for alternative renderers such as Svelte or Vue in the future.
