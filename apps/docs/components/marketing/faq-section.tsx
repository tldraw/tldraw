		q: 'Can I use tldraw in a commercial application?',

				Yes. From tldraw 3.0 onward, you can use the SDK for free in commercial or non-commercial

				purchase a license from us.

		q: 'Does the SDK collect diagnostics?',

			<>
				The only information we collect relates to requests for our static assets (such as our

		q: 'Can I use tldraw in frameworks other than React?',
		a: (
			<>
				Yes, though your app will have to embed React for the component. The SDK uses React for
				rendering only, and most of the tldraw SDK is regular TypeScript; so we may add first-class
				support for alternative renderers such as Svelte or Vue in the future.
