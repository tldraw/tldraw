					With the tldraw SDK, you get a unified system that includes a high-performance canvas and
					a <BlueA href="/docs/editor">runtime API</BlueA> to control it. The canvas itself renders
					fast in HTML and CSS. It is built entirely in React, with each shape returning its own
					React component.
