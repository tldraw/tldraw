## Description

Workspace creation fails completely with a foreign key constraint violation. When attempting to create a new workspace, the API returns "Failed to create workspace" error because the user's ID from Supabase Auth (`auth.users`) does not exist in the public `users` table.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Authenticate with Supabase Auth (user is created in `auth.users` table)
2. Attempt to create a new workspace via POST /api/workspaces
3. Request fails with 500 Internal Server Error

## Expected Behavior

- User should be able to create a workspace after authentication
- The system should ensure authenticated users exist in the public `users` table before workspace operations
- Workspace creation should succeed and return the new workspace

## Actual Behavior

- API returns 500 error with message "Failed to create workspace"
- Database constraint violation occurs: `insert or update on table "workspaces" violates foreign key constraint "workspaces_owner_id_fkey"`
- Error details: `Key (owner_id)=(user-uuid) is not present in table "users"`
- No workspace is created

- `supabase/migrations/20251004152910_tech_01_base_schema.sql:42-44` - Workspaces table with foreign key constraint

## Possible Cause

The application uses Supabase Auth which stores users in the `auth.users` table (managed by Supabase). However, the database schema includes a separate public `users` table that is referenced by foreign keys throughout the application (workspaces, folders, documents, etc.).

**Root cause:** There is no mechanism to sync or provision users from `auth.users` into the public `users` table when they authenticate. The `requireAuth()` function returns a user from `auth.users`, but this user doesn't exist in the public `users` table that the application schema relies on.

This is a data synchronization gap between:
- **Authentication layer**: Supabase Auth (`auth.users`)
- **Application layer**: Public schema foreign key references (`public.users`)

## Proposed Solution

Implement user provisioning to sync authenticated users into the public `users` table. Options:

### Option 1: Database Trigger (Recommended)
Create a Postgres trigger that automatically copies new users from `auth.users` to `public.users` on signup:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, display_name, name)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'display_name',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name'
  )
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
    email = EXCLUDED.email,
    display_name = EXCLUDED.display_name,
    name = EXCLUDED.name,
    updated_at = now();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

### Option 2: Middleware Check
Add middleware to ensure user exists in public.users table on each authenticated request, creating if missing.

### Option 3: Auth Callback
Use Supabase Auth webhooks or callbacks to provision users when they sign up.

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (trigger) is most reliable and requires no application code changes.

## Worklog

**2025-10-05:**
- Bug discovered through user report: "got an error (failed to create workspace)"
- Investigated logs and found multiple instances of the same error
- Identified root cause as missing user sync between auth.users and public.users
- Documented error details and proposed solutions
- **RESOLVED**: Implemented database triggers to sync users and provision workspaces

## Resolution

**Fixed via migration 20251005000000_auth_02_sync_supabase_auth.sql**

The issue was resolved by implementing Option 1 (Database Trigger) from the proposed solutions:

1. **Removed obsolete Better Auth artifacts**:
   - Deleted migration file `20251004180000_auth_01_better_auth_schema.sql`
   - Dropped Better Auth tables: `account`, `session`, `verification`
   - Removed Better Auth columns: `password_hash`, `email_verified`

2. **Created user sync trigger**:
   - `handle_new_user()` function syncs `auth.users` â†’ `public.users` on INSERT/UPDATE
   - Automatically populates display_name and name from user metadata
   - Handles email updates properly

3. **Implemented automatic workspace provisioning**:
   - `provision_user_workspace()` creates a private workspace for each new user
   - Workspace is named "{display_name}'s Workspace"
   - User is added as workspace owner/member

**Test Results**:
- All authentication E2E tests passing (12/13, 1 skipped)
- Signup flow properly creates users in both `auth.users` and `public.users`
- Workspace creation now succeeds without foreign key violations
- User metadata properly synced from Supabase Auth

This solution is atomic, requires no application code changes, and automatically handles all future user signups.
