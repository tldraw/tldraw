## Description

When clicking the "Create Workspace" button on the dashboard, the workspace creation modal does not open or the "Enter workspace name" input field does not appear. The test times out after 30 seconds trying to find the input field.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. Click "Create Workspace" button
3. Input field with placeholder "Enter workspace name" never appears
4. Test times out after 30 seconds

## Expected Behavior

When clicking "Create Workspace" on the dashboard:
1. A modal should open
2. The modal should contain an input field with placeholder "Enter workspace name"
3. User should be able to enter a name and click "Create"
4. Workspace should be created and user redirected to it

## Actual Behavior

After clicking "Create Workspace", the modal either:
- Does not open at all
- Opens but does not render the input field
- Has JavaScript errors preventing the modal from functioning

The test fails with a timeout error after 30 seconds.

## Related Files/Components

- `e2e/member-limit.spec.ts:4`
- `e2e/member-limit.spec.ts:53`
- `e2e/member-limit.spec.ts:123`
- `e2e/workspace-modal-ux.spec.ts:65`
- Dashboard component (workspace creation modal)

## Possible Cause

The workspace creation modal is either:
- Not opening when the button is clicked
- Opening but not rendering the input field
- Has JavaScript errors preventing the modal from functioning
- Missing the required UI components

This is related to BUG-06 (workspace name not visible after creation) and BUG-11 (workspace creation API failing), suggesting a broader issue with the workspace creation flow.

## Proposed Solution

1. Verify the "Create Workspace" button click handler
2. Check if the modal component is properly mounted
3. Ensure the input field is rendered within the modal
4. Fix any JavaScript errors in the modal implementation
5. Add proper error handling and logging

## Worklog

## Resolution

Pending investigation and fix.
