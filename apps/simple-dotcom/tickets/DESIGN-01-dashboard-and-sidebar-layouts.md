## Description

Produce wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for the dashboard and sidebar experience, capturing the simultaneous workspace view, recent documents module, folder trees, and responsive behavior required for the MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Low-fidelity wireframes reviewed with product/engineering covering desktop and tablet breakpoints.
- [ ] High-fidelity mockups delivered in Figma with annotations for layout, spacing, and interaction patterns (hover, selection, collapsible sections).
- [ ] Components and tokens referenced align with DESIGN-05 design system primitives.
- [ ] Accessibility considerations documented (focus order, contrast, keyboard navigation cues).

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- N/A

### API Endpoints

- N/A

### UI Components

- Define layout structure for dashboard shell, sidebar sections, recent documents list, and global search entry point.

### Permissions/Security

- Document states for members vs owners (e.g., visibility of management controls).

## Dependencies

- NAV-02 global dashboard implementation.
- NAV-07 recent documents tracking (for content requirements).
- DESIGN-05 design system foundation.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

## Notes

Provide redlines and responsive behavior notes so engineers can translate layout decisions into Tailwind constraints without additional design passes.

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [x] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
