## Description

Define the core design system assets for the MVP, including color palette, typography scale, spacing system, elevation, iconography, and component primitives usable across product and marketing surfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Figma library set up with documented tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows) and component styles synced.
- [ ] Base components (buttons, inputs, form fields, modals, tables, badges, toasts) documented with variants and interaction states.
- [ ] Accessibility checklist created covering contrast ratios, type sizing, motion guidance, and focus treatments.
- [ ] Exported token definitions or mapping guidance provided for engineering implementation (Tailwind/shadcn integration).

## Technical Details

### UI Components

- Foundation for all UI tickets; deliver UI kit reference linking to component usage guidelines.

### Permissions/Security

## Dependencies

- Supports DESIGN-01 through DESIGN-04 and corresponding engineering tickets (NAV-02, PERM-02, AUTH flows, etc.).

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios
