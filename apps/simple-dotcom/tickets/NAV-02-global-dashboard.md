## Description

Build the `/dashboard` view aggregating all workspaces, documents, folders, and recent items in a single unified experience. The dashboard displays **all accessible workspaces simultaneously** in a sidebar-first layout with collapsible sections for each workspace, eliminating the need for a workspace switcher.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard displays **all accessible workspaces simultaneously** - no workspace switcher or dropdown needed.
- [ ] Sidebar includes collapsible sections for each workspace showing documents and folder trees at once.
- [ ] Dashboard lists private and shared workspaces, recent documents, and folder shortcuts with responsive layout.
- [ ] Quick access to all workspaces and their documents is available without navigation between workspace views.
- [ ] Search bar or filters allow locating documents quickly (linked to NAV-06 search ticket).
- [ ] Data loads efficiently with loading skeletons and empty states for new users.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None beyond existing models; ensure indexes support aggregate queries.

### API Endpoints

- Implement consolidated dashboard API returning userâ€™s workspaces, recents, and favorites in minimal round trips.

### UI Components

- Create reusable cards/list components for workspaces and documents, integrated with action menus.
- Implement responsive sidebar layout with collapsible sections.

### Permissions/Security

- Ensure data respects workspace access controls (PERM-01) and hides soft-deleted content.

## Dependencies

- WS-01 workspace CRUD for data.
- NAV-06 search integration.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios
