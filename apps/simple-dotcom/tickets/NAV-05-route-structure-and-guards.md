## Description

Define Next.js routing structure covering member management, settings, archive, folder, profile, and invitation routes with appropriate role-based guards and layout composition.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Routes exist for workspace settings, member management, archive, folder views, invite management, profile, and marketing pages using shared layouts.
- [ ] Navigation guards redirect unauthorized users to `/403` or login as appropriate, with consistent handling across server/client transitions.
- [ ] Route-level loading and error boundaries are implemented to improve resilience.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None.

### API Endpoints

- Ensure route handlers align with API endpoints defined in other tickets (workspaces, members, invite, share).

### UI Components

- Construct shared layout components (dashboard shell, workspace shell) reused across nested routes.

### Permissions/Security

- Integrate server-side checks in `getServerSideProps`/middleware (or equivalent) to guard routes before render.

## Dependencies

- PERM-01 access control policies.
- NAV-02, NAV-03, MEM tickets for page content.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Manual testing scenarios

## Notes

Ensure route naming and parameter patterns align with analytics tracking and future localization plans.

- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
