## Description

Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention for sensitive endpoints—authentication, invitation link generation, password reset, and sharing—to align with security guidance in engineering notes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Auth endpoints (`/api/auth/*`) enforce per-IP and per-account rate limits with appropriate error messaging.
- [ ] Invitation endpoints (`/api/workspaces/[id]/invite`, `/api/invite/[token]`) throttle regeneration/validation attempts and log suspicious activity.
- [ ] Password reset and share endpoints include rate limiting plus optional captcha hook when thresholds exceeded.
- [ ] Rate limit configuration documented (thresholds, time windows) and monitored via metrics/alerts.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None expected; optionally create audit table for blocked events.

### API Endpoints

- Integrate rate limiting middleware (e.g., Upstash Redis, Cloudflare KV) across targeted routes.
- Standardize 429 responses with retry-after headers for clients.

### UI Components

- Ensure UI handles rate limit responses gracefully (toast/inline messaging) without exposing internal thresholds.

### Permissions/Security

- Align limits with product requirements; implement IP allowlist for internal/admin operations as needed.
- Record blocked attempts for security review.

## Dependencies

- AUTH-01/AUTH-03 authentication endpoints.
- MEM-03 invitation lifecycle.
- PERM-02 sharing endpoint.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

## Related Documentation

- Engineering notes: eng-meeting-notes.md lines 212-214 (rate limiting invites).
- Product requirements referencing invite security.

## Notes

Coordinate with security review (SEC-02, if created later) to validate configuration before launch.

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [x] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
