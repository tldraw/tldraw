## Description

Show which users are viewing or editing a document through real-time presence updates, including avatars/initials and cursor or selection highlights within the canvas.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Presence service emits enter/exit events as users open or close document views and updates UI in under 500ms.
- [ ] Canvas renders collaborator cursors/selections using tldraw presence hooks, and document header shows participant list with **display names/initials only** (never raw emails).
- [ ] Presence state **persists across page refreshes**â€”users who refresh remain visible to collaborators without disconnect/reconnect flicker.
- [ ] Presence respects workspace permissions and hides users who lose access mid-session.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None; presence handled via realtime channels.

### API Endpoints

- Implement `/api/presence` channel negotiation endpoint returning tokens/connection details for Supabase Realtime (or similar).

### UI Components

- Update document header/panel to display participant list; integrate tldraw presence overlays.

### Permissions/Security

- Validate membership before subscribing to presence channels; disconnect clients losing permissions.

## Dependencies

- COLLAB-01 real-time editing transport.
- AUTH-04 display names to show correct user labels.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

## Notes

Plan for optimistic presence removal (timeout after inactivity) to avoid ghost indicators if client disconnects unexpectedly.

## Estimated Complexity

- [x] Small (< 1 day)
- [ ] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
