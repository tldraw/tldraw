## Related Files/Components

- `e2e/ownership-transfer.spec.ts:4` - owner can transfer ownership to another member

## Possible Cause

After completing the ownership transfer:
- The API operation may be completing successfully
- But the redirect logic is missing or not executing
- User remains on the settings page instead of being redirected
- Or there may be an error preventing the operation from completing

## Proposed Solution

Suggested fix or approach to resolve the bug.
