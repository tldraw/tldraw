## Description

Design cohesive UX for signup, login, password recovery, and invite acceptance entry points, including empty and error states for new users landing on the dashboard.

- [ ] Dashboard empty states defined for new accounts (no documents/workspaces) with guidance on next actions.
- [ ] Accessibility specs include form labels, validation messaging, focus order, and minimum contrast ratios.
