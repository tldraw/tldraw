## Description

Implement core email/password authentication flows using Better Auth, covering signup, login, logout, and session refresh across web and API layers. Deliver intuitive auth screens with validation and link-outs between related flows while honoring security expectations for the MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can sign up, log in, and log out through Better Auth-backed endpoints (`/api/auth/*`) with secure session cookies and refresh handling.
- [ ] Auth pages (`/login`, `/signup`, `/logout`) include error handling, form validation, loading states, and links between flows per design guidance.
- [ ] Client-side session context persists across refreshes and expires gracefully when tokens are revoked or become invalid.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- No new tables required; rely on Better Auth user storage with existing Supabase `users` table linkage.

### API Endpoints

- Wire `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/session` to Better Auth SDK following reference implementation.
- Ensure API responses normalize error objects for UI consumption (e.g., invalid credentials, email in use).

### UI Components

- Build shared auth layout with reusable input components and error banners.
- Implement password strength validation and accessible form labeling consistent with shadcn conventions.

### Permissions/Security

- Enforce HTTPS-only cookies, CSRF tokens (if required by Better Auth integration), and rate limiting on auth endpoints.
- Prevent authenticated users from accessing auth pages by redirecting them to `/dashboard`.

## Dependencies

- Better Auth SDK configuration and environment secrets.
- Shared design system components (inputs, buttons) from existing UI kit.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios
