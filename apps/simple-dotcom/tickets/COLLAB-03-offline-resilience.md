## Description

Ensure offline edits are preserved locally and synced once connectivity resumes, leveraging tldraw's offline queue while providing clear status indicators in the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Client detects network interruptions and switches tldraw sessions into offline mode without losing unsaved changes.
- [ ] Upon reconnection, queued edits synchronize successfully to other participants with conflict resolution handled by tldraw sync.
- [ ] UI surfaces unobtrusive offline/online banners or toasts indicating connectivity state and sync progress.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None.

### API Endpoints

- Ensure sync token issuance gracefully handles reconnect attempts after offline periods.

### UI Components

- Add connectivity indicator component to document view showing offline status and retry attempts.

### Permissions/Security

- Maintain permission checks during reconnect to prevent sync if user lost access while offline.

## Dependencies

- COLLAB-01 base sync capabilities.
- TECH-06 offline detection infrastructure.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

## Notes

Document offline behavior for support team, including expected limits (e.g., maximum queued operations, offline duration). 

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [x] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
