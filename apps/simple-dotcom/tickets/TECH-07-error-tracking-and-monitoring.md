## Description

Establish centralized error tracking, logging, and alerting for the Next.js app, API routes, and Cloudflare sync worker so MVP launch has actionable visibility into failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Client app (Next.js) integrated with error tracking provider (e.g., Sentry) capturing exceptions, performance data, and user breadcrumbs (PII-aware).
- [ ] API routes log structured errors and emit alerts for high-severity failures (4xx/5xx spikes) with correlation IDs shared between client/server logs.
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers sync service pushes errors and latency metrics to monitoring stack with alerting thresholds defined.
- [ ] Runbooks documented covering alert response steps and escalation paths.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None.

### API Endpoints

- Inject logging middleware to attach correlation IDs and forward to logging provider.

### UI Components

- Add global error boundary/fallback UI for unhandled client errors; tie into tracking provider.

### Permissions/Security

- Scrub PII from logs; ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance by redacting personal data.

## Dependencies

- PERF-01 performance metrics instrumentation (share dashboards).
- TECH-03 deployment environment configuration for secrets.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

## Related Documentation

- Product requirements: product-requirements.md (supporting notes on dependencies & risks).
- Engineering notes: sections on monitoring and contingency.

## Notes

Include staging vs production separation and verify error reporting in both environments before launch.

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [x] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
