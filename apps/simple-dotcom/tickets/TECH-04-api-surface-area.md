## Description

Define and implement RESTful API endpoints covering workspaces, documents, folders, members, invites, sharing, and presence, ensuring consistent conventions, versioning, and documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API routes implemented per specification with consistent naming, HTTP verbs, and error formats.
- [ ] OpenAPI (or similar) documentation generated and published for internal use, kept in sync with code.
- [ ] API integration tests validate critical flows and permissions across endpoints.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None beyond existing tables.

### API Endpoints

- Implement routes: `/api/workspaces`, `/api/documents`, `/api/folders`, `/api/workspaces/[id]/members`, `/api/workspaces/[id]/invite`, `/api/documents/[id]/share`, `/api/presence`, plus supporting endpoints.
- Adopt consistent response wrappers and error codes.

### UI Components

- Provide typed API client utilities for front-end consumption.

### Permissions/Security

- Integrate authentication middleware, rate limiting, and logging across all endpoints.

## Dependencies

- TECH-01 schema foundation.
- PERM-01 access control policies.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

## Notes

Establish versioning strategy (e.g., `/api/v1`) to support future backward-compatible changes.

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [x] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
