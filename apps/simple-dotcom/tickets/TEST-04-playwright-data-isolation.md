## Description

Improve the Playwright E2E suite so each run starts from a deterministic state and leaves the database clean. Current fixtures only delete Supabase auth users, letting related rows in `workspaces`, `workspace_members`, and session tables accumulate. This causes flaky tests that pass in isolation but fail when suites run together. We need robust setup/teardown to satisfy the specâ€™s testing guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Playwright fixtures delete all records created for a test user across auth, workspace, document, session, and membership tables before the next test begins. Failures in cleanup must fail the test with actionable logging.
- [ ] Global test setup (or a Supabase RPC/script) truncates relevant tables before a Playwright run so suites never inherit dirty state from previous executions.
- [ ] Workspace tests wrap Supabase admin mutations in helpers that assert success, preventing silent cleanup failures.
- [ ] Documentation in `e2e/README.md` (or equivalent) explains the isolation strategy and how to run the reset utilities locally and in CI.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None expected; use existing tables. If truncation requires additional permissions, add a service-role RPC for tests.

### API Endpoints

- Optional: add `/api/test/reset` (guarded by non-production env checks) or a Supabase function invoked from Playwright global setup.

### UI Components

- No UI impact.

### Permissions/Security

- Ensure cleanup utilities use service-role keys and are only callable in test environments. Guard any new endpoints behind `NODE_ENV === 'test'` checks.

## Dependencies

- TEST-01 Playwright E2E suite (baseline infrastructure).
- AUTH-02 Provision private workspace on signup (fixture relies on this behavior).
- AUTH-05 Private workspace validation rules (cleanup touches those rows).

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Manual testing scenarios

- `SPECIFICATION.md` > **Technical Architecture & Implementation** > Supabase setup (service role usage).

## Notes

- Consider toggling `playwright.config.ts` to record traces from run start (`trace: 'on'`) and `preserveOutput: 'always'` so trace directories remain stable during retries.
- Evaluate whether current Supabase project should be dedicated to automated tests to avoid cross-env interference.

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [x] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)

## Worklog

[Pending]

## Open questions

- Should we add a reusable Supabase SQL script or rely on a Next.js API endpoint for database resets?
- Do we need to snapshot specific seed data (e.g., marketing content) after truncation, or can the app boot from an empty state?
