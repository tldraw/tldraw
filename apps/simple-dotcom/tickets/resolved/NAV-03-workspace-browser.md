## Description

Create workspace-level browsing experience at `/workspace/[id]` with folder tree navigation, archive access, and creation controls for documents and folders.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Workspace view renders hierarchical folder tree, document lists, and quick actions aligned with role permissions.

- [x] Data fetching respects workspace scoping and updates in real time when changes occur.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

### API Endpoints

- Provide workspace-scoped fetch endpoints for folders/documents with pagination and filtering.

### UI Components

### Permissions/Security

## Dependencies

- WS-04 archive management for navigation link.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios
