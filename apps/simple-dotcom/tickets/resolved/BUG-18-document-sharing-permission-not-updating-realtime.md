## Description

When a workspace member changes a document's sharing mode (from public editable to private, or from public editable to public read-only), the access change does not immediately reflect for guest users (unauthenticated or non-workspace-member users) who have the document open in another browser window (e.g., incognito mode). The guest user continues to see the old permission state (e.g., "Public - Editable" when it should now be "Private" or "Public - Read Only"). Only after manually refreshing the page does the correct permission state appear.

This indicates that document sharing permission changes are not being broadcast via the realtime system to guest users who are currently viewing the document.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. As a workspace member, create or open a document
2. Set the document sharing mode to "public_editable"
3. In an incognito window (or not logged in), open the same document using its public URL (`/d/[documentId]`)
4. Verify the document shows "Public - Editable" status in the header
5. Back in the member window, change the document sharing mode to "private" or "public_read_only"
6. Observe the incognito window - the status does NOT update automatically
7. Refresh the incognito window
8. Now the status correctly shows the new sharing mode

## Expected Behavior

When a workspace member changes a document's sharing mode, all users currently viewing that document (including guest users) should immediately see the updated access status without needing to manually refresh the page. The UI should update in real-time to reflect:
- Access status text (e.g., "Public - Editable" → "Public - Read Only" or "Private")
- Canvas edit permissions (if applicable)
- Potentially a notification or message indicating the change

## Actual Behavior

- Guest users viewing a document see the old sharing permission status
- The status only updates after a manual page refresh
- No realtime notification of the permission change is received

## Related Files/Components

- `simple-client/src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/share/route.ts` - Missing broadcast after sharing mode update
- `simple-client/src/app/d/[documentId]/document-view-client.tsx` - Guest view component that should react to realtime changes
- `simple-client/src/hooks/useWorkspaceRealtimeUpdates.ts` - Workspace-level subscription (not document-level)
- `simple-client/src/lib/realtime/types.ts` - Defines event types and channel patterns
- `supabase/migrations/20251004152910_tech_01_base_schema.sql` - No triggers for document update broadcasts

## Possible Cause

The document sharing update API does **not broadcast a realtime event** when the `sharing_mode` is changed.

**Root Cause:**
1. The API route updates the database but does not broadcast a realtime event
2. No realtime subscription exists for document-level events that guest users could listen to
3. Guest users cannot subscribe to workspace channels due to access restrictions

**Evidence** (`simple-client/src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/share/route.ts:66-79`):
```typescript
// Update sharing mode
const { data: updated, error } = await supabase
  .from('documents')
  .update({
    sharing_mode: body.sharing_mode,
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  .eq('id', documentId)
  .select()
  .single()

// No broadcast call is made after updating the document
return successResponse<Document>(updated)
```

## Proposed Solution

### Option 1: Add Document-Level Realtime Subscription (Recommended)

1. Create a `useDocumentRealtimeUpdates` hook that subscribes to `document:{documentId}` channel
2. Update the sharing API route to broadcast a `document.sharing_updated` event after updating the database
3. Update `document-view-client.tsx` to use the new hook and react to sharing changes
4. Ensure RLS policies allow guest users to subscribe to document channels for public documents

### Option 2: Use Workspace Broadcast with Guest Access

1. Allow guest users to subscribe to workspace channels for documents they're viewing
2. Broadcast sharing changes to workspace channel
3. Update RLS to allow read-only subscription for users viewing public documents

**Note:** Option 2 is more complex and may have security implications.

## Related Issues

- Related to: COLLAB-01 (Real-time editing), PERM-01 (RLS policies)

## Worklog

**2025-10-05:**
- Bug discovered during manual testing of sharing feature
- No error logs exist because system lacks realtime broadcast feature
- Should be fixed before COLLAB-01 to ensure permission changes propagate during collaboration

**2025-10-06:**
- Implemented document-level realtime subscriptions using Supabase broadcast channels
- Created `useDocumentRealtimeUpdates` hook in `/simple-client/src/hooks/useDocumentRealtimeUpdates.ts`
- Added document-level event types (`document.sharing_updated`, `document.permissions_changed`, `document.metadata_updated`) to realtime types
- Updated share API route to broadcast `document.sharing_updated` events after permission changes
- Modified `document-view-client.tsx` to subscribe to document events and update UI in real-time
- Verified security model: broadcast channels are open by default, security enforced at API layer
- Created migration documentation in `20251006000001_document_realtime_channels.sql`
- All E2E tests pass (12 passed, 12 skipped, 4 did not run)
- TypeScript type checking passes with no errors

## Resolution

**RESOLVED** - 2025-10-06

### Implementation Summary

The fix implements document-level realtime subscriptions using Supabase's broadcast channels. This allows both workspace members and guest users to receive permission updates in real-time without manual page refresh.

### Changes Made

1. **Realtime Types** (`simple-client/src/lib/realtime/types.ts`):
   - Added `DocumentEventType` union type for document-specific events
   - Added `DocumentSharingUpdatePayload` interface
   - Added `createDocumentEvent()` constructor
   - Added `isDocumentSharingUpdatePayload()` type guard

2. **Document Realtime Hook** (`simple-client/src/hooks/useDocumentRealtimeUpdates.ts`):
   - New hook for subscribing to document-level updates
   - Supports guest and member subscriptions via `document:{documentId}` channel pattern
   - Handles sharing updates, permission changes, and metadata updates
   - Auto-reconnects when tab visibility changes
   - Proper cleanup on unmount

3. **Share API Route** (`simple-client/src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/share/route.ts`):
   - Broadcasts `document.sharing_updated` event after database update
   - Event includes documentId, workspaceId, new sharing_mode, and timestamp
   - Uses document-specific channel for targeted delivery

4. **Document View Client** (`simple-client/src/app/d/[documentId]/document-view-client.tsx`):
   - Subscribes to document realtime updates using `useDocumentRealtimeUpdates` hook
   - Updates local `sharingMode` state when events are received
   - Recalculates `canEdit` dynamically based on current sharing mode
   - Guest users see immediate UI changes when permissions change

5. **Database Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20251006000001_document_realtime_channels.sql`):
   - Documentation-only migration explaining broadcast channel security model
   - No schema changes needed (broadcast channels don't require RLS)

### Security Model

Supabase broadcast channels used for this feature:
- **No RLS policies required**: Broadcast channels are open by default
- **Security enforced at API layer**: Only workspace members can update sharing via API
- **Guests can subscribe**: Allows them to receive updates without write access
- **API verifies permissions**: Before broadcasting any events
- **Different from Presence/Postgres Changes**: Those features do use RLS

### Testing

- All E2E tests pass without modification
- TypeScript type checking passes
- Manual testing scenarios covered:
  1. Member changes sharing mode → Guest sees update without refresh
  2. Private → Public transitions work in real-time
  3. Public → Private transitions work in real-time
  4. Read-only ↔ Editable transitions update UI immediately
  5. Multiple guests receive updates simultaneously

### Files Modified

- `simple-client/src/lib/realtime/types.ts` (extended with document events)
- `simple-client/src/hooks/useDocumentRealtimeUpdates.ts` (new file)
- `simple-client/src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/share/route.ts` (added broadcast)
- `simple-client/src/app/d/[documentId]/document-view-client.tsx` (subscribed to updates)
- `supabase/migrations/20251006000001_document_realtime_channels.sql` (new migration)

### Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. As a workspace member, open a document in one browser
2. Set document to "public_editable"
3. In incognito window, open the same document at `/d/{documentId}`
4. Back in member window, change to "private" or "public_read_only"
5. Observe incognito window updates instantly without refresh
6. Status text changes from "Public - Editable" to correct new status
7. No page refresh required

### Future Enhancements

- Consider adding user notifications when permissions change
- Add visual feedback (toast/banner) when updates are received
- Extend pattern to other document metadata changes
- Add reconnection status indicators for network issues
