## Description

**NOTE: This is a TEST ISSUE, not an application bug.** The test uses incorrect route and selectors.

When attempting to sign in as a new user during the member limit API warning test, the page/browser crashes or closes unexpectedly. The test tries to fill in the email field on the sign-in page but fails because the target page has been closed.

**Root Cause:** Test uses `/sign-in` route (which doesn't exist) instead of `/login`, and uses placeholder selectors instead of `data-testid` selectors.

This affects the E2E test:
- `member-limit.spec.ts` > "Workspace Member Limits" > "shows warning in API response when near limit"

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a workspace and add 89 members (approaching limit)
2. Create a new user account
3. Navigate to `/sign-in` page
4. Attempt to fill in the email placeholder field
5. Page crashes before the field can be filled

## Expected Behavior

- Sign-in page should load successfully
- Email input field should be accessible with placeholder "email@example.com"
- Password field should be accessible
- Sign-in form should be functional
- Page should remain stable

## Actual Behavior

- Test times out after 30 seconds
- Error: "Target page, context or browser has been closed"
- Cannot access the email input field
- Page crashes before sign-in can be completed

## Error Message

```
Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded.

Error: locator.fill: Target page, context or browser has been closed
Call log:
  - waiting for getByPlaceholder('email@example.com')

  175 | 		// Sign in as the new user
  176 | 		await page.goto('/sign-in')
> 177 | 		await page.getByPlaceholder('email@example.com').fill(newMemberEmail)
```

## Potential Causes

1. **Wrong sign-in route**: Test uses `/sign-in` but actual route might be `/login`
2. **JavaScript crash**: Sign-in page has an unhandled error that crashes the page
3. **Redirect loop**: Page might be redirecting infinitely
4. **Missing sign-in page**: The `/sign-in` route might not exist
5. **Auth state issue**: Pre-existing auth state causes the page to crash or redirect
6. **Different field selectors**: The email field might not use placeholder "email@example.com"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Sign-in page loads successfully at the correct route
- [x] Email and password fields are accessible
- [x] Field selectors match actual implementation
- [x] Page remains stable (no crashes)
- [x] Sign-in flow completes successfully
- [x] E2E test passes without timeout

## Related Files

- `e2e/member-limit.spec.ts:123-208` - Failing test (line 177)
- Sign-in page route (verify `/sign-in` vs `/login`)
- Authentication components

## Testing Requirements

- [x] E2E test exists and is failing
- [ ] Manual testing required
- [ ] Browser console logs needed
- [ ] Fix verification needed

## Investigation Steps

1. **Verify sign-in route**: Check if the app uses `/sign-in` or `/login`
   - Look at existing passing auth tests to see which route they use
   - Update test if route is different

2. **Check field selectors**: Verify the actual placeholder text used
   - Tests might be using wrong selectors
   - Compare with working auth tests

3. **Test manually**: Navigate to sign-in page in browser
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console
   - Verify page loads correctly

4. **Review test setup**: Check if previous test steps leave auth state
   - Clear cookies/storage between contexts
   - Ensure clean browser context

## Notes

Looking at other test files:
- `auth.spec.ts` and `invite.spec.ts` likely use `/login` route
- They use selectors like `[data-testid="email-input"]` instead of placeholders
- This test may need to be updated to match actual implementation

The test appears to be using incorrect route and field selectors that don't match the actual application.

## Recommended Fix

Update the test to use the correct route and selectors:
```typescript
// Change from:
await page.goto('/sign-in')
await page.getByPlaceholder('email@example.com').fill(newMemberEmail)
await page.getByPlaceholder('Enter your password').fill('Password123!')
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign In' }).click()

// To:
await page.goto('/login')
await page.fill('[data-testid="email-input"]', newMemberEmail)
await page.fill('[data-testid="password-input"]', 'Password123!')
await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]')
```

## Resolution

**Fixed on 2025-10-08**

The test has been successfully fixed with the following changes:

1. **Fixed test route and selectors** (`e2e/member-limit.spec.ts:155-158`):
   - Changed route from `/sign-in` to `/login`
   - Updated selectors to use `data-testid` attributes instead of placeholders
   - Changed button click from `getByRole` to `data-testid` selector

2. **Fixed browser context issue** (`e2e/member-limit.spec.ts:154-176`):
   - Created a new browser context for the new user to avoid auth state conflicts
   - Used `newUserContext` and `newUserPage` for login and API calls
   - Added proper cleanup of the new context

3. **Fixed API bug** (`src/app/api/invite/[token]/join/route.ts:117-121`):
   - Discovered and fixed a bug in the join API where it was using `workspace_role` instead of `role`
   - The column name in the `workspace_members` table is `role`, not `workspace_role`
   - This was causing the insert to fail with a 500 error

4. **Added user sync wait** (`e2e/member-limit.spec.ts:158-172`):
   - Added wait logic to ensure the user is synced to `public.users` table via trigger
   - Added `user_metadata` with name and display_name for consistency with other tests

**Test Result:** âœ… Test now passes successfully in 11.4s

The test correctly:
- Navigates to the login page without crashes
- Signs in the new user successfully
- Makes the API call to join the workspace
- Receives a 200 response with the expected warning message
- Verifies the member count is 91 as expected
