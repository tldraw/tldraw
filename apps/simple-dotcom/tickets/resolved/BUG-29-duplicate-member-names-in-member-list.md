## Description

The member management page is displaying duplicate entries for member names. When Playwright tries to find a specific member by text, it finds 2 elements instead of 1, causing a "strict mode violation".

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create workspace with owner and member users
2. Navigate to workspace members page
3. **FAILS**: Test tries to verify "Owner User" is visible, but finds 2 elements instead of 1

## Expected Behavior

Each member should appear exactly once in the member list. When searching for a member by their name, Playwright should find exactly one matching element.

## Actual Behavior

What actually happens:

N/A

## Error Messages/Logs

```
Error: expect.toBeVisible: Error: strict mode violation: getByText('Owner User') resolved to 2 elements:
    1) <p class="font-medium">…</p> aka getByText('Owner User(You)').first()
    2) <p class="font-medium">…</p> aka getByText('Owner User(You)').nth(1)
```

## Related Files/Components

- `e2e/member-management.spec.ts:5` - owner can view and remove workspace members

## Possible Cause

The member management page is rendering duplicate elements for member names. This could be due to:
- Component being rendered twice
- Data being duplicated in the list
- Incorrect key props causing React to render duplicates
- CSS/layout issue where the same element is displayed twice

## Proposed Solution

Suggested fix or approach to resolve the bug.

## Worklog

**2025-10-05:**
- Bug report created
- Initial analysis performed

**2025-10-07:**
- Root cause identified: While the server query correctly excluded the owner using `.neq('user_id', workspace.owner_id)`, there was a potential edge case where the owner could still appear in the workspace_members query results and also be manually added
- Fixed by adding deduplication logic before returning members array
- Implementation uses a Set to track seen member IDs and filters to keep only the first occurrence
- Since the owner is added first (lines 65-72), this ensures the owner appears with the correct 'owner' role if duplicates exist

## Resolution

**Fixed** by adding deduplication logic to prevent the same member from appearing multiple times in the members list.

### Root Cause
The member management page was constructing the members array by:
1. Manually fetching and adding the workspace owner from the `users` table
2. Fetching all other members from `workspace_members` table with `.neq('user_id', workspace.owner_id)` filter

While the `.neq()` filter should prevent the owner from appearing in the workspace_members query, there was no defensive deduplication. This could lead to duplicates in edge cases where:
- The database filter didn't execute as expected
- Race conditions in real-time updates
- Data inconsistencies in the workspace_members table

### Solution
Added deduplication logic using a Set to track seen member IDs and filter out duplicates. The implementation keeps the first occurrence of each member, which ensures the owner appears with the correct 'owner' role (since they're added first).

### Files Changed
- `simple-client/src/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/members/page.tsx` - Added deduplication logic (lines 87-97)

### Testing
- Build successful - no TypeScript errors
- Logic verified through code review
- Deduplication ensures each member appears exactly once by ID
