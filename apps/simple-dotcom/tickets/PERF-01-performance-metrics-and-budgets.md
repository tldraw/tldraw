## Description

Instrument application to monitor key performance targets (document load <2s, sync latency <200ms, workspace queries <1s, search <500ms) and implement optimizations necessary to meet these budgets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Metrics collected for document load time, query latency, search response, and sync latency, exposed via dashboards (e.g., Logflare, Datadog).
- [ ] Performance budget alerts configured when thresholds exceeded in staging and production.
- [ ] Identified hotspots addressed or documented mitigation plans before launch.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None.

### API Endpoints

- Add timing instrumentation (middleware) to log API latency for critical routes.

### UI Components

- Implement client-side performance marks for document load and search operations.

### Permissions/Security

- Ensure instrumentation data does not leak sensitive identifiers; aggregate by workspace ID where possible.

## Dependencies

- COLLAB-01 for sync latency measurement.
- NAV-06 search implementation for response timing integration.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

## Notes

Collaborate with infra team to determine monitoring stack; attach charts to launch review.

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [x] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
