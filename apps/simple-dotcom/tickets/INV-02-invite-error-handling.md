## Description

Provide clear error states for disabled, regenerated, or already-used invitation links, guiding users to request a new invite and preventing ambiguous failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Invite validation returns specific error codes for disabled links, regenerated tokens, and existing membership scenarios.
- [ ] Invite landing page displays tailored messaging for each error type with CTA to contact workspace owner or login.
- [ ] Analytics capture error occurrences to help monitor invite health.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

- None.

### API Endpoints

- Update `/api/invite/[token]` responses to include structured error details; ensure HTTP status codes align with UI expectations.

### UI Components

- Build error view variants within invite page with appropriate icons/copy.

### Permissions/Security

- Avoid revealing workspace details for invalid tokens beyond generic messaging to prevent enumeration.

## Dependencies

- MEM-04 join-by-link flow.

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [x] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [x] Manual testing scenarios

- [ ] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (3-5 days)
- [ ] Extra Large (> 5 days)
