# Simple tldraw App â€” Product Requirements

## Overview
- Deliver a collaborative whiteboard experience built on the tldraw infinite canvas with Supabase-backed persistence and real-time collaboration.
- Support both private and shared workspaces so individuals can organize personal boards and collaborate with teams under a unified interface.
- Launch an MVP that prioritizes the P0 feature set defined in product and engineering notes; defer advanced capabilities to the post-MVP backlog captured below.

## User Roles & Access Levels
- **Workspace Owner**: Creates shared workspaces, holds administrative control (member management, settings, deletion) and owns the private workspace generated at signup.
- **Workspace Member**: Invited collaborator with full document and folder capabilities inside the shared workspace but limited administrative permissions.
- **Guest**: Unauthenticated or non-member user accessing a public document via shared link; capabilities depend on the document's sharing state (read-only vs editable).

## MVP Requirements

### Authentication & Account Management
| ID | Requirement | Engineering Notes | Design Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AUTH-01 | Provide email/password signup, login, logout, and session management using Better Auth. | Integrate Better Auth endpoints under `/api/auth/*`; enforce secure session handling and refresh. | Design streamlined auth screens with clear primary actions and links between login, signup, and password reset. |
| AUTH-02 | Automatically create a non-deletable, non-renamable private workspace for each new user. | Trigger private workspace provisioning immediately after successful signup; store ownership in Supabase. | Surface private workspace in dashboard alongside shared workspaces with explanatory copy. |
| AUTH-03 | Offer password recovery via `/forgot-password` and `/reset-password` routes. | Implement email token-based reset flow with Better Auth; ensure tokens validate before password change. | Provide accessible forms with validation messaging and clear success/error states. |
| AUTH-04 | Support basic user profiles capturing name, email, and display name. | Store profile fields in Supabase `users` table; expose read/write API under `/profile`. | Create simple profile edit screen prioritizing form clarity; no advanced customization in MVP. |

### Workspace Foundation & Management
| ID | Requirement | Engineering Notes | Design Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-01 | Enable creation, renaming, and soft deletion of shared workspaces. | Persist workspaces in Supabase with `is_deleted` flag; expose CRUD via `/api/workspaces`. | Provide create workspace affordance on dashboard; use confirmation for soft delete with recovery guidance. |
| WS-02 | Restrict workspace deletion to owners and enforce transfer-or-delete rules before an owner exits. | Validate ownership before delete; block `leave` action unless ownership transferred or workspace deleted. | Communicate ownership constraints in settings UI; prompt owners when attempting to leave. |

## Supporting Notes & Constraints
- Document export, advanced profiles, notifications, audit logs, additional document types, granular permissions, document versioning UI, advanced workspace settings, templates, bulk operations, and OAuth are explicitly post-MVP.
- Pricing, Workers resource limits, and Better Auth contingency plans require architectural flexibility to swap providers without major refactors.
- Team expectation: 2â€“3 engineers (frontend, backend/infrastructure, full-stack) working in parallel on app, API, and sync components.
- No predefined product UI exists beyond the tldraw canvas; engineering should collaborate with design for first-pass UI, then hand off for refinement.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Authentication Provider Risk**: Abstract auth layer to allow migration to Supabase Auth or custom JWT if Better Auth falls short.
- **Cloudflare Worker Limits**: Observe CPU (50ms/request) and memory (128MB) constraints; use Durable Objects for long-lived WebSocket sessions.
- **Supabase Scaling**: Monitor real-time channel usage and database performance within defined sanity limits.
- **Reuse Opportunities**: Leverage patterns from existing dotcom app, templates, and sync-worker to accelerate development and ensure consistency.
