# Simple tldraw Specification

## Product Overview
- Collaborative whiteboard application built on the tldraw infinite canvas with Supabase-backed persistence and real-time collaboration.
- Unified experience for private and shared workspaces so individuals can organize personal boards and collaborate with teams in one interface.
- MVP focuses on the P0 feature set defined below; advanced capabilities move to the post-MVP backlog for future iterations.

## User Roles & Access Levels
- **Workspace Owner**: Creates shared workspaces, manages members and settings, and controls the private workspace provisioned at signup.
- **Workspace Member**: Invited collaborator with full document and folder capabilities inside shared workspaces but limited administrative permissions.
- **Guest**: Unauthenticated or non-member user accessing a shared document via link; capabilities depend on the document's sharing mode (read-only vs editable).

## MVP Scope
### Goals
- Authentication and account management.
- Private and shared workspaces with membership controls.
- Document and folder organization.
- Real-time collaboration across canvases.
- Sharing and permissions enforcement.
- Core UI and UX to support the above experiences.

### Non-Goals & Future Enhancements
- All features captured in the Post-MVP backlog table later in this document are explicitly out of scope for the MVP.
- Advanced functionality such as document templates, expanded permissions, exports, and rich profile customization are deferred.

### Constraints & Operational Limits
- Target ceilings: ~100 workspaces per user, ~100 members per workspace, ~1000 documents per workspace, 10 levels of folder depth, and ~10MB document payloads.
- Network resilience must handle offline edits with graceful recovery.
- Team expectation: 2â€“3 engineers (frontend, backend/infrastructure, full-stack) working in parallel on app, API, and sync layers.

## Supporting Notes & Constraints
- Post-MVP capabilities (exports, advanced profiles, notifications, audit logs, advanced document types, granular permissions, templates, bulk operations, OAuth) remain out of scope until future phases.
- Pricing, Cloudflare Workers resource limits, and Better Auth contingency plans require architectural flexibility to swap providers without major refactors.
- Collaboration with design is necessary for first-pass UI beyond the tldraw canvas before final polish.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Abstract authentication integration so migration to Supabase Auth or custom JWT remains viable if Better Auth fails to meet needs.
- Monitor Cloudflare Worker CPU (50ms/request) and memory (128MB) constraints; Durable Objects manage long-lived WebSocket sessions.
- Watch Supabase Realtime channel usage and database performance within defined sanity limits.
- Heavy reliance on Better Auth integration complexity, Cloudflare Worker scalability, Supabase rate limits, R2 storage costs, and folder hierarchy performance are primary technical risks.

## Technical Architecture & Implementation

### System Architecture Overview
- Next.js client hosted on Vercel powers the marketing site and authenticated application experience.
- Supabase PostgreSQL with Realtime delivers persistence, RLS-backed access control, and change streams.
- Cloudflare Durable Objects worker manages tldraw synchronization over WebSockets.
- Cloudflare R2 stores document snapshots and large binary assets.

### Monorepo Structure
- `apps/simple-client`: Next.js application implementing marketing, dashboard, workspace, and document routes.
- `workers/simple-worker`: Cloudflare worker responsible for sync, permission verification, and snapshot handling.
- `packages/simple-shared`: Shared types, schema definitions, and utilities reused across client and worker.

### Data Flow & Technology Rationale
- Client â†’ API â†’ Database for CRUD operations through Next.js API routes backed by Supabase queries.
- Client â†’ Sync Worker â†’ R2 for high-frequency canvas updates, with snapshots written to R2 and metadata persisted in Supabase.
- Supabase Realtime delivers workspace, document, folder, and presence updates to the client and worker layers.
- Better Auth selected for composable email/password flows; Cloudflare Workers provide low-latency sync; Supabase offers RLS-first multi-tenant data model; R2 delivers cost-effective object storage.

### Data Model
- Core tables: `users`, `workspaces`, `workspace_members`, `invitation_links`, `folders`, `documents`, `document_access_log`, and `presence`.
- Relationships enforce ownership, membership roles, and folder hierarchies via adjacency list patterns with max-depth validation and cycle prevention.
- Index strategy covers primary keys, foreign keys, and performance/search indexes (including `pg_trgm`) to support global search and filters.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Better Auth integration handles session management, token issuance, email/password flows, and API route validation.
- Authorization layers operate across frontend gating, server-side validation, Supabase RLS policies, and worker-level checks before enabling sync actions.
- Permission model differentiates owners, members, and guests at workspace and document scopes, including guest read/edit rules as defined in the requirements.

### API Surface
- Authentication: `POST /api/auth/signup`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/session`.
- Workspaces: `GET|POST /api/workspaces`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/workspaces/:workspaceId`, `POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/leave`, `POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/transfer-ownership`.
- Invitations: `GET /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/invite`, `POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/invite/regenerate`, `PATCH /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/invite`, `POST /api/invite/:token/join`.
- Documents: `GET|POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/documents`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/documents/:documentId`, `POST /api/documents/:documentId/duplicate`, `PATCH /api/documents/:documentId/share`, `POST /api/documents/:documentId/access`.
- Folders: `GET|POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/folders`, `PATCH|DELETE /api/folders/:folderId`.
- Members: `GET /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/members`, `DELETE /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/members/:userId`.
- Search: `GET /api/search`.
- Presence: `POST /api/presence/:documentId`, `GET /api/presence/:documentId`.
- Error handling aligns with consistent status codes and structured payloads across endpoints.

### Sync Worker Architecture
- Durable Object instances provisioned per document manage WebSocket connections, state replication, and write throttling.
- Worker entry point routes HTTP and WebSocket requests, performs session validation, handles CORS, and upgrades connections.
- Permission validation occurs before joining sync rooms, differentiating read vs write access for members and guests.
- R2 snapshot strategy defines snapshot cadence, naming conventions, metadata management, and backup retention aligned with storage costs.
- Supabase integration within the worker uses service-role keys to fetch permissions and update metadata.

### Frontend Architecture
- Route structure covers public marketing (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`, etc.) and authenticated routes (`/dashboard`, `/workspace/*`, `/d/*`) guarded with middleware.
- Component layers include shared layouts, workspace navigation components, document canvases, folder trees, and search surfaces.
- State management combines React Context providers for auth/session, React Query (or equivalent) for server state, and localized state for UI controls.
- Real-time updates leverage Supabase Realtime subscriptions with clear channel strategy, optimistic updates, and conflict resolution patterns.
- tldraw integration includes editor initialization, permission-aware tool configuration, and custom UI components around the canvas.

### Real-Time Collaboration
- Canvas sync connects clients to the Cloudflare worker via WebSockets for high-frequency updates and optimistic rendering.
- Presence system uses Supabase Realtime to track active viewers/editors, broadcast cursor positions, and show active user indicators.
- Application data sync keeps workspace lists, folder trees, and permission states consistent through channel separation (canvas, app data, presence).

### Performance & Optimization
- Database access optimized via efficient joins, batching, pagination, and index usage on hot paths (dashboard, search, membership lists).
- Caching strategy specifies short-lived caches with explicit invalidation triggers driven by Realtime events.
- Channel optimization covers subscribe/unsubscribe patterns, connection cleanup, and pooling to respect Worker limits.
- Frontend performance relies on code splitting, lazy loading, virtualized lists, and debounced inputs, while R2 snapshot compression manages storage efficiency.

### Security Considerations
- Authentication security enforces secure cookies, CSRF protections, and password policies defined by Better Auth.
- Authorization defense in depth spans client gating, API checks, Supabase RLS, and worker-side verification to prevent privilege escalation.
- Input validation uses shared schema validation (e.g., Zod) to prevent injection and XSS, with consistent error messaging.
- Rate limiting covers per-user and per-endpoint limits plus invite link protections to deter abuse.
- Data privacy ensures email visibility restrictions, guest data handling, and clear soft-delete semantics.

### Testing Strategy
- Playwright-based end-to-end suite spans authentication, workspace management, document/folder operations, search, sync, and permissions.
- Multiplayer testing simulates concurrent sessions to verify presence, conflict resolution, and offline-to-online transitions.
- Performance benchmarks validate load time (<2s), sync latency (<200ms), and search responsiveness (<500ms) against instrumentation.
- Test data seeding uses dedicated Supabase projects and Worker environments with scripted fixtures and cleanup routines.

### Deployment & Environments
- Environment tiers (development, staging, production) require consistent configuration management and secrets handling.
- Next.js app deploys via Vercel with proper build settings, environment variables, and custom domains.
- Cloudflare worker deploys through Wrangler with Durable Object bindings, R2 configuration, and secret rotation.
- Supabase setup includes migrations, RLS enablement, Realtime configuration, and extension installation (e.g., `pg_trgm`).
- CI/CD pipeline runs builds, automated tests, and orchestrates deployments with rollback procedures.

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** â€” Monorepo setup, authentication, and base schema.
2. **Phase 2: Workspace & Document Core** â€” Workspace/document CRUD and initial tldraw wiring.
3. **Phase 3: Organization & Folders** â€” Folder system, hierarchy validation, drag-and-drop.
4. **Phase 4: Real-Time Sync** â€” Sync worker integration, presence system, real-time updates.
5. **Phase 5: Permissions & Sharing** â€” Sharing flows, guest access, archive/restore.
6. **Phase 6: Search & Polish** â€” Search implementation, error handling, performance tuning.
7. **Phase 7: Testing & Launch** â€” E2E coverage, performance testing, production deployment.

### Edge Cases & Scenario Coverage
- Invitation flows: unauthenticated access, disabled/regenerated links, already-a-member handling.
- Document sharing: switching privacy while guests editing, workspace deletion during guest sessions, moves during active edits.
- Workspace management: owner exit restrictions, last member leaving, ownership transfer permutations.
- Folder operations: cycle prevention, maximum depth enforcement, moving/deleting large hierarchies.
- Offline and recovery: network interruptions, worker downtime, Supabase outages, and associated recovery strategies.

### Open Questions & Outstanding Decisions
- Folder deletion behavior (cascade vs prevent) and document duplication scope.
- Workspace deletion retention, rate limiting specifics, and placement for recent documents UI.

### Success Metrics
- MVP launch criteria cover functional completeness, performance targets, security posture, and documentation readiness.
- Post-launch metrics track usage (DAU, documents created), performance (latencies, error rates), and business outcomes (retention, conversion).

### Reference Implementations
- Reuse patterns from `apps/dotcom` for auth flows, sync worker architecture, Supabase integration, and error handling.
- Reference template projects for baseline tldraw setup and canvas initialization.
- Key files from existing repositories provide migration examples and architectural guidance.
