/* 
A utility class for the card shape. This is where you define the shape's behavior, 
how it renders (its component and indicator), and how it handles different events.

[1]
A validation schema for the shape's props (optional)
Check out card-shape-props.ts for more info.

[2]
Migrations for upgrading shapes (optional)
Check out card-shape-migrations.ts for more info.

[3]
Letting the editor know if the shape's aspect ratio is locked, and whether it 
can be resized or bound to other shapes. 

[4]
The default props the shape will be rendered with when click-creating one.

[5]
We use this to calculate the shape's geometry for hit-testing, bindings and
doing other geometric calculations. 

[6]
Render method — the React component that will be rendered for the shape. It takes the 
shape as an argument. HTMLContainer is just a div that's being used to wrap our text 
and button. We can get the shape's bounds using our own getGeometry method.
	
- [a] Check it out! We can do normal React stuff here like using setState.
   Annoying: eslint sometimes thinks this is a class component, but it's not.

- [b] You need to stop the pointer down event on buttons, otherwise the editor will
	   think you're trying to select drag the shape.

[7]
Indicator — used when hovering over a shape or when it's selected; must return only SVG elements here

[8]
Resize handler — called when the shape is resized. Sometimes you'll want to do some 
custom logic here, but for our purposes, this is fine.
