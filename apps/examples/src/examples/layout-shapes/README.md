This example demonstrates how to use the `layoutShapes` method in tldraw to automatically arrange shapes on the canvas and remove overlaps. The toolbar provides several layout options:

- **Simple**: Arranges shapes without animation.
- **Animation**: Arranges shapes with a smooth animated transition.
- **Padding**: Arranges shapes with a specified padding between them.
- **Weight**: Arranges shapes and applies a higher weight (1000) to selected shapes, affecting their layout priority.

You can select shapes and apply these different layout strategies using the toolbar buttons. The example shows how to customize the toolbar and use the `layoutShapes` method with various options such as animation, padding, and weighting.
