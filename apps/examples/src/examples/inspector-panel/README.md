Display an inspector panel that shows the properties of the currently selected shape.

---

This example demonstrates how to create an inspector panel that displays all properties of the currently selected shape. When a single shape is selected, the panel shows the shape's type, position, dimensions, and all custom properties. The panel updates reactively as you select different shapes or modify their properties.

The inspector shows:

- Basic shape properties (id, type, position, rotation, etc.)
- Shape-specific props (dimensions, colors, styles, etc.)
- Meta information and other attributes

This is useful for debugging, educational purposes, or creating admin interfaces where you need to inspect shape data.
