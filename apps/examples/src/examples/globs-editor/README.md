A globs based vector editor, based on the https://jcgt.org/published/0004/03/01/paper-lowres.pdf paper.

Some useful shortcuts:

- Place a node by pressing 'n'
- Create a glob by selecting a node and pressing 'c' and either place a new node or connect to an existing one
- Hold 'cmd' whilst dragging "d" handles to drag that handle and its opposite
- Hold 'cmd' whilst dragging tension handles to drag its opposite handle
- Hold 'cmd + shift' to drag all four tension handles on a glob together
