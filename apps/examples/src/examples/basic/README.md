The `Tldraw` component provides the tldraw editor as a regular React component. You can put this component anywhere in your React project. In this example, we make the component take up the height and width of the container.

By default, the component does not persist between refreshes or sync locally between tabs. To keep your work after a refresh, check the [`persistenceKey`](https://tldraw.dev/examples/basic/peristence-key) example.
