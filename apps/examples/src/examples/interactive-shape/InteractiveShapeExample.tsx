[1]
By default the editor handles pointer events, but sometimes you want to handle 
interactions on your shape in your own ways, for example via a button. You can do this 
by using the css property `pointer events: all` and stopping event propagation. In 
this example we want our todo shape to have a checkbox so the user can mark them as 
done.

Check out my-interactive-shape-util.tsx to see how we create the shape.
