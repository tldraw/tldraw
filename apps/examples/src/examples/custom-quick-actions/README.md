You can customize tldraw's quick actions, a collection of components that appear next to the menu button, or in the toolbar on smaller sizes.

---

The quick actions component can be customized by providing a `QuickActionsContent` component to the `Tldraw` component's `components` prop. If you provide `null`, then that component will be hidden.
