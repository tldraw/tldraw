Show a contextual toolbar above the shapes when they are selected.

---

An example of how to show a contextual toolbar which appears on top of the selected shapes. It is displayed above the canvas, but below other UI elements.

Select shapes of different types and adjust the size of the shapes - this works just like adjusting the size from the Style panel on the right side.
