Align and distribute shapes using the editor's built-in methods.

---

This example demonstrates how to use the `alignShapes` and `distributeShapes` methods to programmatically arrange shapes on the canvas. The example creates 5 shapes at different positions and provides buttons to align them (left, center-horizontal, right, top, center-vertical, bottom) or distribute them (horizontal, vertical). Select multiple shapes and click the buttons to see the alignment and distribution in action. Note that align operations require at least 2 shapes, while distribute operations require at least 3 shapes.
