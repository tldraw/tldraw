Automatically arrange shapes using stack and pack operations.

This example demonstrates how to use `stackShapes()` and `packShapes()` to automatically arrange shapes into organized layouts. Stacking arranges shapes in a sequence (horizontal or vertical) with consistent gaps, while packing uses a bin-packing algorithm to organize shapes into a compact grid.
