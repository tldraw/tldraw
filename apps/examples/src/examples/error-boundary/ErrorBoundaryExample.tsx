/* 
This example shows how the tldraw error boundary can allow you to render a custom error
fallback for shapes that throw errors. We simulate this scenario by creating a shape
that always throws an error when it renders.

[1] 
We have a shape util that always throws an error when it renders. Check out ErrorShape.ts
to see how this works. It's important to define this array of shape utils outside of a
React competent so that they are not recreated on every render.

[2]
We pass in our shape util to the tldraw component. We also pass in a custom error fallback
component that will be used to render any shapes that throw an error. Check out the 
custom component example for more examples of components you can customize.

[3]
When the app starts, we create our error shape and center the camera.
