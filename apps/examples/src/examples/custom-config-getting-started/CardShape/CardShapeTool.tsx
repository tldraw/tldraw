This file contains our custom tool. The tool is a StateNode with the `id` "card".

We get a lot of functionality for free by extending the BaseBoxShapeTool. but we can
handle events in out own way by overriding methods like onDoubleClick. For an example 
of a tool with more custom functionality, check out the screenshot-tool example.
