Customize the available stroke and font sizes in tldraw.

---

Override the `STROKE_SIZES`, and `FONT_SIZES` constants to override the default values.

Note that this will change the stroke and font sizes for ALL instances of tldraw. For example, if you run this example locally, and then open another example, the changes will be present there too until you reload!
