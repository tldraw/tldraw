Change the tldraw theme colors.

---

While there's currently no way to add or remove our colors from our default shapes' colors, this example shows how you can adjust the values for the default color styles.

Note that this will change the colors for ALL instances of tldraw. For example, try loading this example and then loading another example—the changes will be present there too until you reload!
