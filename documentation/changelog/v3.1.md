## v3.1.0

This release introduces shape visibility control and server-side data manipulation capabilities, alongside API enhancements and bug fixes.

### Improvements

- Add `isShapeHidden` predicate option to prevent shapes from being rendered or reacting to pointer events, useful for implementing permission systems in collaborative applications ([#4570](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4570))
- Add server-side document manipulation through the `updateShapes` method on the tldraw sync server, facilitating third-party service integration ([#4581](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4581))

### API changes

- `Editor.rotateShapesBy` now accepts an option specifying rotation center point
- The `useAsset` hook has been published for resolving responsive asset versions

### Bug fixes

- Fix arrow label text measurement calculations
- Fix arrow collaborator indicators overlapping labels
- Fix binding processing error handling
- Fix watermark opacity and animation behavior
