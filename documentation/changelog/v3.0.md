## v3.0.0

This release introduces a revised licensing model alongside deep links, enhanced image export, custom embeds, and a new text search API.

## What's new

### New licensing model

The most significant change involves updated licenses permitting use in both commercial and non-commercial projects when displaying a "Made with tldraw" watermark. Users can now purchase Business Licenses to remove the watermark, with details available at [tldraw.dev](https://tldraw.dev).

### Deep links

New APIs enable creation of shareable URLs pointing to specific canvas locations, such as particular shapes or pages, with automatic URL updates as users navigate. ([#4498](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4498))

### Enhanced image export

Custom shapes now export as images by default through HTML/CSS embedding within SVG files, eliminating the need for developers to implement custom SVG rendering methods.

### Custom embeds API

Developers can now customize which external websites (YouTube, Google Maps, CodeSandbox, etc.) appear as embeddable content, or add entirely new embed types.

### Text search via getText API

A new `getText` API provides reliable access to human-readable shape content, facilitating text search implementation within applications.

### Breaking changes

- Removed the `TLRotationSnapshot` type
- `onEditorMount` renamed to `onMount` in `createTLStore`
- `Editor.mark()` deprecated in favor of `Editor.markHistoryStoppingPoint()`
- `TLSvgOptions` renamed to `TLImageExportOptions`
- Focus event behavior changed for `updateInstanceState({isFocused: true})`
