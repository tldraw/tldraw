# Nuggets

This section contains short, focused articles about interesting technical details within the tldraw library. These are "behind-the-scenes" explorations of implementation choices, surprising behaviors, and solutions to non-obvious problems.

## What belongs here

- **Surprising details**: Unexpected behaviors or edge cases in common features
- **Unintuitive implementations**: Places where the code takes an unexpected approach due to specific constraints
- **Clever solutions**: Techniques developed to solve complex problems
- **Platform quirks**: Browser limitations, API inconsistencies, and workarounds

## Purpose

These articles serve as technical reference for contributors and curious developers who want to understand why certain parts of tldraw work the way they do. Unlike tutorials or guides, nuggets focus on the "why" behind implementation decisions rather than the "how" of using features.

## Writing style

These articles are closer to tech blog content than documentation. They should be interesting. Their voice should be similar to an internal document that is written to share something interesting with the rest of the team. Some duplication of information is appropriate in these files in order to preserve the readability of the article. We can link out to sources at the bottom of the file.
